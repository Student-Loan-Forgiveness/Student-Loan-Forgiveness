<h1>Introduction</h1>

<div class="column" style="width:60%;">
<p>Neural Networks are supervised machine learning models which draw inspiration from the human brain. Specifically, they attempt to model how the neurons in the human brain work. Although this won’t serve any justice to the true complexities of the biology behind neurons, the general extension to machine learning can be explained.</p>
<ul>
<li>Neurons are connected to each other.</li>
<li>They send signals (or information) to each other.</li>
<li>The connections between the neurons form a network of neurons.</li>
<li>Neurons will fire (or send an electrical pulse) when a threshold is reached:</li>
<li>Connected neurons will receive that pulse.</li>
<li>In turn, the pulse may bring the connected neurons to their threshold causing them to fire.</li>
<li>This continues within the layers of connected nodes, propagating information through the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research on algorithmically modeling and implementing the structure of the brain into a computational asset has been ongoing for decades <span class="citation" data-cites="towardsaiBriefHistory">[<a href="#ref-towardsaiBriefHistory" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. There have been periods of stagnation and periods of brilliant breakthroughs culminating in the diverse neural network architectures available today. In fact, one notable problem accounted for both a momentary lag and then an explosion, the XOR Problem. The framework can be described as a binary operation that takes two binary inputs and produces a binary output, where the output of the operation is 1 only when the inputs are different. The initial issue was that primitive neural networks, represented by a single-layer perceptron (or artificial neuron) failed to solve this problem due to the data not being linearly separable. However, the breakthrough occurred when feedforward neural networks (or multi-layer perceptron) were developed <span class="citation" data-cites="geeksforgeeksNeuralNetworks">[<a href="#ref-geeksforgeeksNeuralNetworks" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. A feedforward neural network has an input layer which takes the input, a hidden layer which applies non-linear activation functions to create transformed features which aid in separating classes, and an output layer for the result.</p>
<section id="the-breakthrough-architecture" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-breakthrough-architecture">The Breakthrough Architecture</h2>
<p>A simple modern architecture for a neural network usually consists of layered nodes, where each progressive layer is fully connected to its previous layer. In technical jargon, this is also referred to as “dense” and just means that every single node in a layer is connected to every single node in the next layer. The first layer is known as the input layer and the last layer is known as the output layer. The layers between the input and output layers are referred to as <em>hidden</em> simply due to that fact that generally only the input and output of the network is <em>seen</em>. A network can have as many hidden layers and hidden nodes as conceivable (and computationally attainable).</p>
<p>As partially described in the architectural solution to the XOR Problem above, the layers use activation functions to transform the information when it is passed between nodes. This solves the problem of non-linearly separable classes. A simple perceptron can actually be thought in terms of a classic linear model.</p>
<p>Remember that simple line formula from high school algebra with slope (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) and intercept (<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>)?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y=mx+b \]</span></p>
<p>This can be extended to allow for additional variables and even vectorized:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y = w_1 x_1 + \dots + w_k x_k + b\]</span></p>
<p>In machine learning, the <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>’s are commonly referred to as <em>weigths</em> and the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as bias. The equation above represents a linear model where the <span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are its parameters, which are optimized to fit the data and make predictions (hence the <em>parametric model</em> nomenclature).</p>
<p>Given a linear model with 3 input variables (or features), this could be represented by a perceptron.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + b\]</span></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/nn/simple_perceptron.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img" style="width:50.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Referring to the nodes and arrows from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>First “Input” Layer of Nodes: 3 features (<span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>’s)</li>
<li>First Set of Arrows: 3 weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>’s)</li>
<li>Second “Hidden” Layer: computes <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}w_ix_i + b\)</span></li>
<li>Last “Output” Layer: returns the result <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The issue is that the output is an unbounded real number. For a binary classification problem where the output should be either 0 or 1, this doesn’t bode well. Activation functions account for this by bounding the output. There are plenty of choices for activation functions, each with their own strengths and use cases. Some of the most common activation functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sigmoid</li>
<li>Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)</li>
<li>ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sigmoid works well for binary classification problem with its ability to “squeeze” <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> between 0 and 1.</p>
<p><strong>Sigmoid Function</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the Sigmoid activation function works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First “Input” Layer of Nodes: 3 features (<span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span>’s)</li>
<li>First Set of Arrows: 3 weights (<span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span>’s)</li>
<li>Second “Hidden” Layer: computes <span class="math inline">\(z=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}w_ix_i + b \rightarrow g(z)\)</span></li>
<li>Last “Output” Layer: returns the result <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y} = g(z)\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>How does a neural network actually work and how does it improve its predictions?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feed Forward</strong>: propagate information through network from input to output:
<ul>
<li>Obtain Predition <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Loss Function</strong>: calculate loss compared to known labels (i.e., supervised machine learning), also known as error or cost. Quite a few options to obtain error between <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>. Some popular choices are:
<ul>
<li>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
<li>Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)</li>
<li>Categorical Cross Entropy (CCE)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Backpropagation</strong>: from output to input (hence <em>back</em>), calculate the partial derivates for the cost function with respect to the parameters and layers:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\nabla C = [\frac{\partial C}{\partial W_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial C}{\partial W_L}, \frac{\partial C}{\partial b_1}, \dots, \frac{\partial C}{\partial b_L}]\)</span></li>
<li>Where <span class="math inline">\(W_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> are weights and biases, respectively, for layer <span class="math inline">\(i \in [1, \dots, L]\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the output layer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gradient Descent</strong>: Update the weights and biases with a learning rate (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) multiplied by the partial derivates.</li>
<li><strong>Iterate, Iterate, Iterate…</strong>: Repeat this process many times. Each iteration is known as an <em>epoch</em>. Ultimately, the goal is to have the cost continuously reducing on each epoch, eventually converging to a minimum (hopefully close to 0).</li>
</ul>

In particular, it used articles from media organizations with known Left or Right political bias. Neural Networks are a supervised machine learning method. Supervised Machine Learning models require labeled data, or known tags on the data to train the model. Additionally, when teaching the models, the data is split into disjoint training and testing sets. In essence, the models learn from the training set and then are tested on unseen data. This helps to prevent overfitting and simulates applying the model on real-world data.</p>

He summarily fired prosecutors, inspectors general and board members of independent agencies in defiance of legal rules against arbitrary removal.\u201d\\nBiden, during his presidency, imposed vaccine mandates, pressured social media platforms to censor content, attempted to implement a student loan forgiveness plan that was ruled unconstitutional and unilaterally declared that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) had become law despite lacking congressional approval.\\nBiden in December 2020 pledged not to impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate once he became president, but issued multiple mandates upon taking office.\\nHis administration required federal employees and contractors to get vaccinated or tested for the virus and also imposed a vaccine-or-testing rule for private businesses with more than 100 employees. The Supreme Court struck down the private sector mandate in January 2022.\\nUnder the Biden administration, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin required service members to take the COVID-19 vaccine, discharging over 8,000 service members for refusing. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 to reinstate them, restoring them to their prior rank with full back pay and benefits.\\nThe Biden administration also pushed Big Tech companies to restrict content during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, it pressured Facebook to censor posts regarding the pandemic that it deemed misinformation, according to documents published by House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan in July 2023.\\nJudge Terry A. Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued an injunction on July 4, 2023, ruling that the Biden administration likely breached the First Amendment when it collaborated with social media platforms to censor information it opposed.\\nDoughty described the censorship as \u201cOrwellian,\u201d stating that Republican attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri \u201cproduced evidence of a massive effort by Defendants, from the White House to federal agencies, to suppress speech based on its content.\u201d\\nBiden\u2019s White House also influenced Amazon in March 2021 to restrict the visibility of books that expressed skepticism regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, according to emails the House Judiciary Committee obtained.\\nMoreover, although the Supreme Court ruled against the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to forgive student debt in June 2023, his administration continued to press ahead with student forgiveness schemes until the very end of his presidency.

"The Republican Party is intent on permanently extending the 2017 tax cuts which primarily benefited the wealthiest earners and corporations\u2014a priority that would cost an estimated $4.6 trillion and which has sent lawmakers searching for potential spending offsets including cuts to Medicare, food assistance, and renewable energy programs.\\nBut polling released Tuesday suggested the GOP is likely to face widespread outcry\u2014and potential opposition from vulnerable Republicans who don't want to risk angering voters\u2014as a majority of Americans are vehemently opposed to paying for tax cuts for the wealthy by slashing public programs.\\nThe new poll, taken by Data for Progress on behalf of the progressive advocacy groups Groundwork Collaborative and the Student Borrower Protection Center, found that although Republican lawmakers have demonized efforts to provide relief to student loan borrowers, the party's potential overhaul of the income-based repayment program isn't popular among voters of any political ideology.\\nNearly two-thirds of respondents said they don't want the repayment plan eliminated, including 56% of Republican voters and 70% of Independents who said they oppose funding cuts for federal student loans and grants.\\nThe GOP's plan would save an estimated $127.3 billion over 10 years by forcing the average student loan borrower to pay nearly $200 more per month.\\n\"Most people don't have an extra $200 a month to throw toward their student loan bill,\" Michele Shepard Zampini, senior director of college affordability at the Institute for College Access & Success, toldCNBC on Monday.\\n\"Voters overwhelmingly reject efforts to cut critical supports that working families rely on.\"\\nDespite that fact, said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director for the Student Borrower Protection Center, the GOP's budget proposals would \"cut taxes for their billionaire buddies by raiding the pockets of Americans with student debt and families already struggling to pay for college.\"\\n\"This polling makes it crystal clear,\" she said. \"Voters overwhelmingly reject efforts to cut critical supports that working families rely on.\"\\nRepublicans can also expect to see pushback if they attempt cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, the survey found. Ninety percent of respondents said they want Medicare funding to increase or remain the same; 87% said the same for Medicaid. Republicans are planning to unveil the first-ever work requirements for Medicaid, which provides healthcare coverage for low-income people and those with disabilities, in an upcoming budget bill.\\nAs Politicoreported Sunday, Republican lawmakers are \"increasingly alarmed\" that Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), chair of the House Budget Committee, \"keeps raising Medicare reforms as a potential spending offset.\"\\nMore than 80% of respondents also don't want Republicans to make cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which the GOP is also planning to make subject to expanded work requirements.\\nThose who want funding for SNAP to increase or stay the same include 67% of Republicans and 75% of Independents.\\nThe polling may leave Republican leaders wondering what programs they will be able to cut without facing outcry from angry voters who rely on public services\u2014but Elizabeth Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy for Groundwork Collaborative, suggested in a statement Tuesday that the answer is simple: The GOP must abandon its plan to dole out more tax breaks for the rich.\\n\"Voters are clear about what they want: Lower prices, better jobs, vital programs protected and expanded, and for the wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes,\" said Pancotti. \"And yet, Republicans in both chambers of Congress are working overtime to achieve the exact opposite.\"\\nPresident Donald Trump has called on the GOP to advance his taxation, immigration, and energy agenda in \"one big, beautiful bill,\" while Senate Republican leaders have begun work on two separate bills, with taxes dealt with later in the year.\\n\"Whether one bill or two,\" said Pancotti, \"House and Senate GOP members are aligned on wanting to cut lifesaving programs in order to enrich their billionaire friends and donors, and voters are taking note.\"", "republican party intent permanently extending tax cut primarily benefited wealthiest earner corporation priority cost estimated trillion sent lawmaker searching potential spending offset including cut medicare food assistance renewable energy program polling released tuesday suggested gop likely face widespread outcry potential opposition vulnerable republican want risk angering voter majority american vehemently opposed paying tax cut wealthy slashing public program new poll taken data progress behalf progressive advocacy group groundwork collaborative student borrower protection center republican lawmaker demonized effort provide relief student loan borrower party potential overhaul income based repayment program popular voter political ideology nearly third respondent said want repayment plan eliminated including republican voter independent said oppose funding cut federal student loan grant gop plan save estimated billion year forcing average student loan borrower pay nearly month people extra month throw student loan michele shepard zampini senior director college affordability institute college access success toldcnbc monday voter overwhelmingly reject effort cut critical support working family rely despite fact said aissa canchola banez policy director student borrower protection center gop budget proposal cut tax billionaire buddy raiding pocket american student debt family struggling pay college polling make crystal clear said voter overwhelmingly reject effort cut critical support working family rely republican expect pushback attempt cut medicare medicaid survey ninety percent respondent said want medicare funding increase remain said medicaid republican planning unveil work requirement medicaid provides healthcare coverage low income people disability upcoming budget politicoreported sunday republican lawmaker increasingly alarmed rep jodey arrington texas chair house budget committee keep raising medicare reform potential spending offset respondent want republican make cut supplemental nutrition assistance program snap commonly known food stamp gop planning make subject expanded work requirement want funding snap increase stay include republican independent polling leave republican leader wondering program able cut facing outcry angry voter rely public service elizabeth pancotti managing director policy advocacy groundwork collaborative suggested statement tuesday answer simple gop abandon plan dole tax break rich voter clear want lower price better job vital program protected expanded wealthy pay fair share tax said pancotti republican chamber congress working overtime achieve exact opposite president donald trump called gop advance taxation immigration energy agenda big beautiful senate republican leader begun work separate bill tax dealt later year said pancotti house senate gop member aligned wanting cut lifesaving program order enrich billionaire friend donor voter taking note"], ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2024/12/18/biden-administration-re-opens-paye-and-icr-for-student-loan-borrowers/", "Center", "US President Joe Biden speaks during a Hanukkah holiday reception in the East Room of the White ... [+] House on December 16, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)\\nThe Department of Education, under the Biden Administration, confirmed this week that the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plans are re-opened for enrollments, with some restrictions due to the ongoing lawsuits.\\nIn updated guidance shared this week, the Department of Education confirms: \u201cAs of December 16, 2024 borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans: Pay As You Earn (PAYE), SAVE (previously known as REPAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.\u201d\\nHowever, not all features of the plans may be in effect because of the lawsuits.\\nThe PAYE and ICR plans were originally closed to new enrollment on June 30, 2024 due to the advent of the new SAVE plan. However, when the SAVE plan was put on hold by the courts, the Department of Education issued rules to re-open the PAYE and ICR plans for borrowers who may want to select these options.\\nThe PAYE student loan repayment plan caps your monthly student loan payment at 10% of your discretionary income, which is set at 150% of the poverty guidelines. PAYE also provides loan forgiveness after borrowers are enrolled in the plan for 20 years. However, to qualify, borrowers must have a partial financial hardship, meaning that the PAYE payment would be lower than what they would pay under the Standard 10-year Repayment Plan.\\nThe ICR student loan repayment plan is not as generous, as it caps your monthly student loan payment at the lesser of 20% of your discretionary income or what your payment would be on a fixed 12-year payment plan, after you adjust it for income. However, discretionary income under this plan is calculated at 100% of your state\u2019s poverty guideline. Forgiveness on ICR takes up to 25 years.\\nThe Department of Education confirmed that student loan servicers (like MOHELA and Aidvantage) are processing student loan repayment plan requests. According to the updated statement, \u201cIn the coming weeks, the Department expects servicers to begin processing certain IDR applications that were paused following court orders affecting the terms and availability of IDR plans.\u201d\\nThey also confirmed that \u201cServicers will also process applications for recalculations for IBR, ICR, and PAYE. Servicers will have applications in the queue that will take some time to work through.\u201d\\nHowever, according to reports from borrowers on Reddit, loan servicers are estimating the backlog of repayment plan applications could take upwards of 8 weeks or more to process.\\nAccording to the Department of Education, \u201cIf servicers need time to process a borrower\u2019s IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance is eligible for PSLF and IDR forgiveness. If the borrower\u2019s application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \u201c\\nIt\u2019s important to note that loan forgiveness under PAYE and ICR is currently blocked, just like any SAVE loan forgiveness. Only loan forgiveness for borrowers under the Income Based Repayment (IBR) plan is currently being processed, since this program was enacted separately by Congress.\\nHowever, for borrowers who reach the loan forgiveness time milestones under these plans, the Department of Education has announced that borrowers would move to an interest-free forbearance while they wait.\\n\u201cBorrowers who reach their plan\u2019s repayment milestone\u2014that is, 25 years in repayment for borrowers on any of these plans or 20 years for borrowers in PAYE or undergraduate-only borrowers in SAVE\u2014will be moved into an interest-free forbearance, if they are not already in a forbearance as a result of the litigation.\u201d\\nWith these latest updates in mind, should borrowers consider switching to PAYE or ICR if they qualify? For most borrowers under the SAVE litigation forbearance, the answer is no.\\nSince borrowers on the SAVE litigation hold are in an interest-free forbearance, there are no payments due and no interest is accruing. Borrowers should, instead, be using this time to improve their finances, save their estimated payments, and plan for what payments could look like when they resume.\\nHowever, for borrowers who are close to achieving loan forgiveness under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), there may be opportunities under these plans to achieve your loan forgiveness milestone of 120 payments. For borrowers close to the 120 payment mark (say, within 5-6 months of payments), switching payment plans may get you to the 120 mark quicker than waiting for the SAVE litigation to resolve.\\nThe other option is PSLF Buy Back, which will allow borrowers to buy back missing PSLF credits once they reach 120, but this program is currently difficult to navigate and requires a borrower to hit the 120 milestone before taking action.\\nThe Buy Back may be a better option for borrowers who have less than 100 payments credited towards PSLF.", "president joe biden speaks hanukkah holiday reception

their CEO works for Donald Trump at this point,\" Gerber added.\\nThe bromance between Musk and President-elect Donald Trump has been on full display for months.\\nTrump and Musk have publicly praised each other, and the latter has donated at least $132 million to Trump's and other Republicans' campaigns.\\nFor his public support, Trump awarded Musk a role in his administration alongside another ardent supporter, Vivek Ramaswamy, as the head of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\\nMusk has been spending considerable time at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, meeting with world leaders and advising Trump. He even interjected himself into a contentious debt ceiling debate this month, which almost led to a government shutdown.\\nRead more: How a government shutdown would impact your student loans, Social Security, investments, and more\\nNevertheless, the market has rallied since Trump's November presidential win, particularly sectors that are seen as beneficiaries of his policies. Though the president-elect has not been a fan of green energy and may withdraw the $7,500 EV credit created under the Biden administration, Tesla may be in a favorable position due to its CEO's connection with Trump.\\nTesla stock rose over 1% on Tuesday in premarket trading. Shares have surged 74% since Election Day, outpacing the S&P 500's nearly 5% gain.\\nGerber believes 2025 will prove critical for Tesla and Musk's preoccupation with the Trump administration means the wider Tesla team must step it up. Only three people are listed as executive team members on Tesla's investor relations page: Musk, new senior automotive vice president Tom Zhu, and new CFO Vaibhav Taneja.\\nIf not, the stock could be penalized amid signs that execution isn't first-rate enough to justify Tesla's heady valuation.\\n\"It's yet to be seen whether this [Tesla] team can prove themselves,\" Gerber said. \"The old team at Tesla, which I knew very well, was very capable, but they were all let go in the last year.

The development was first reported by Axios.\\n\"It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people \u2014 some of the same people that I had to deal with. He wasn't quite as successful, but he had somebody that saw what was going on. I didn't know him, other than I believe he was on 'The Apprentice' for a little while,\" said President Trump. \"He was just a very nice person. He had a fantastic wife. She fought like hell to get him out. He was given a sentence of like 18 years [sic], and it was a terrible injustice. They just were after him. They go after a lot of people.\"\\nBlagojevich was originally sentenced to 14 years in prison in December 2011 on 18 corruption charges, including attempting to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat after Obama won the White House in 2008. Blagojevich only served nearly eight years before being commuted in February 2020 during Mr. Trump's first presidency.\\nUpon his release from prison, he told CBS Chicago that he believed he \"was sent to prison for practicing politics,\" but also admitted to having made \"mistakes.\"\\nLegally, a pardon goes further than a sentence commutation. A pardon is official forgiveness \u2014 with all the rights lost by a convicted felon being restored with a pardon.\\nSpeaking Monday evening outside his home in Chicago's Ravenswood Manor neighborhood, Blagojevich expressed his \"deepest and most profound and everlasting gratitude\" to President Trump.\\n\"I think about my relationship with President Trump, and it's really\u2014well, he's always doing things for me, and he never asks me to do anything for him. I had a chance to be on his television show, and he ended what was a long, long, hard nightmare, after 2,986 days in prison \u2014 nearly eight years \u2014 President Trump pulled me out of there,\" Blagojevich said, \"and now he did this. And all I can tell you is that President Trump is a man who when he sees things that are wrong, he rights them. He puts an end to them.\"\\nBlagojevich maintained that he never broke any laws.\\n\"I never took a penny. It was all politics \u2014 routine political conversations that were begun by then-President-elect Obama, who sent an emissary to me to talk about making what the appellate court called a routine political deal when they reversed the so-called sale of the Senate seat,\" Blagojevich said. \"They were fake charges, and the big lie was told by the prosecutor and his office that did to me and my family what they did.\"\\nBlagojevich also compared his own plight to that of President Trump, who was convicted in New York in May of last year on 34 charges in a scheme to influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn star. In January, two months after being elected to a new term, Mr. Trump received an unconditional discharge \u2014 meaning he would face no penalties.\\n\"His resilience, his strength, his fortitude, his unwillingness to give in, is an inspiration and an example of the kind of leader that he is,\" Blagojevich said. \"I could never give in. I want to say to the people of Illinois two things. Number one, I never raised your taxes, and number two, I didn't do it. It was all political talk.\"\\nBlagojevich said he first learned of the pardon two weeks ago while at home with his wife, Patti. The former governor said President Trump called him and told him what would be happening this present Monday.\\nMonths after his release, Blagojevich filed a federal lawsuit claiming his removal from office by the Illinois Senate following his 2009 impeachment trial was unconstitutional and sought the ability to run for state or local elected office in Illinois.\\nIn 2024, a judge issued a ruling in Blagojevich's filed lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban on him running for state or local office. The judge's ruling utilized allusions to Dr. Seuss to underline their message.\\n\"Read generally Dr. Seuss, Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now! (1972) ('The time has come. The time has come. The time is now. Just Go. Go. GO! I don't care how. You can go by foot. You can go by cow. Marvin K. Mooney, will you please go now!'),\" U.S. District Judge Steven Seeger wrote.\\nBlagojevich and Mr. Trump have worked together in the past. He appeared in Season 3 of the reality competition show \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" in which he was \"fired\" by Mr. Trump during the season's run.\\nIn fact, Blagojevich mentioned Mr. Trump \u2014 then not yet president or a presidential candidate \u2014 in the hours before reporting to prison in 2012.\\n\"I got fired by Donald Trump,\" Blagojevich said at the time. \"This thing I've got to do now is worse.\"\\nThe news of the pardon sets in motion a possible political revival. While Blagojevich remains barred from holding elected office in Illinois after his impeachment from office, there has been word lately he could be named ambassador to Serbia in the new Trump White House.\\nIn 1999, Blagojevich, who has Serbian roots, joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson as Jackson helped broker the release of three American prisoners in Serbia. Blagojevich was a U.S. congressman at the time.\\nNow, 26 years and a political lifetime later, speculation has been that Blagojevich may be dispatched back to the region of his ancestors by the very man who released him from prison early \u2014 as the Rod Blagojevich story takes another unexpected turn.\\nWhen asked in the Oval Office whether he was considering Blagojevich for ambassador to Serbia, President Trump said: \"No, but I would. He's now cleaner than anybody in this room.\"\\nBlagojevich declined to comment Monday night on the speculation about the ambassadorship.\\nThe political land mines Blagojevich faced resemble much of Trump's political career. Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Blagojevich, represented former FBI Director James Comey, whom President Trump fired from the agency in 2017.\\nComey was working in the private sector during the Blagojevich investigation and indictment.\\nFormer special counsel Robert Mueller, who oversaw the investigation into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, was FBI director during the investigation into Blagojevich.\\nWhat the pardon means for Blagojevich's electability moving forward remained unclear late Monday.\\nBlagojevich himself is excited and pleased with the pardon. But other politicians from Illinois do not see it that way.\\n\"I strongly disagree with President Donald Trump's decision to pardon disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich,\" Illinois Senate Republican Leader John Curran (R-Lemont) said in a news release. \"Illinois taxpayers have and continue to be burdened with the cost of public corruption, and this pardon sends the wrong message.\"\\nU.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) issued a statement denouncing the pardon: \"In a state with more than its fair share of public corruption, the Blagojevich chapter still looms as one of the worst. America and Serbia deserve better.\"\\nIllinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza also issued a statement, pointing out that Blagojevich was also convicted of trying to shake down Children's Memorial Hospital \u2014 the predecessor to Lurie Children's Hospital:\\n\"President Trump has the power as president to pardon whomever he wants.\\nThe president can pardon someone as unworthy as Rod Blagojevich, who threatened to hold up funds from a children's hospital unless the hospital's CEO donated to his campaign. That was my bill to fund treatment for sick children that Blagojevich held up.\\n\"Long before it was fashionable to criticize the governor of my own party, I was a lonely voice calling for Blagojevich's impeachment. I stand by my remarks on the floor of the House during his impeachment after I co-sponsored the bill to launch the impeachment committee against Blagojevich:\\n\"'It's amazingly fitting that Governor Blagojevich face impeachment today of all days on his self-admitted hero Richard Nixon's birthday. Their common bond of impeachment will unite them in history's dark annals of corruption. But even Nixon displayed more integrity than Blagojevich by resigning before he was impeached.'\\n\"'I sponsored House Bill 5331 that would have provided $8 million for specialty care pediatricians in Illinois. Those sick children, Governor, they're still waiting. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that Governor Blagojevich would have pulled back funds for sick children in order to extort the president of the children's hospital.'\\n\"A pardon does not erase his crimes from the memory of many Illinoisans whose trust he violated and it never will.\"\\nAdam Harrington, Sara Cook, Todd Feurer and Dana Kozlov contributed to this report.\\nJeramie Bizzle is a web producer for CBS Chicago.

[+] (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT / AFP) (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP via Getty Images)\\nWhile it\u2019s hard to keep track of all the different scams Americans have to deal with in their everyday lives, the Federal Trade Commission has revealed that total losses to fraud nationwide topped more than $10 billion in 2023. Final fraud statistics for 2024 aren't quite out yet, but FTC data shows some alarming trends in terms of the types of scams that are out there.\\nFor example, online job scams were huge in 2024, as well as employment scams taking place via text. Other popular scams last year involved criminals impersonating government officials, gift card scams, phishing scams, charity scams and the always-popular business and investment scams.\\nStudent loan scams have also run rampant over the last few years, especially since there\u2019s been so much uncertainty when it comes to potential forgiveness plans for federal student loans. While the Biden administration tried to forgive millions of dollars in student loan debt and was successful at forgiving student debt for more than 5 million borrowers, the changing headlines have been downright confusing.\\nNot only did several of former President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plans get struck down by the courts, but the same thing may happen to the Saving On a Valuable Education income-driven repayment plan. The fate of this repayment plan still hangs in the balance to this day as borrowers await a decision from the courts on the legality of the plan.\\nAll of this has paved the way for scammers to jump right in with brand new student loan scams that prey on borrowers who are desperate to have their loans forgiven. Here are some of the newest and most common student loan scams to watch out for in 2025.\\nStudent loan forgiveness scams come in several different forms, but they\u2019re all built around the fact it's so hard to keep up with the headlines these days.\\nEssentially, scammers reach out to people with student loan debt and promise them help getting their loans forgiven, either through traditional government forgiveness plans or other sources of debt relief.\\nOf course, the assistance is entirely fake and the criminals are usually trying to get their hands on the borrower's sensitive personal information in order to steal their identities.\\nSome student loan forgiveness scams are phishing scams, where they send out a fake email or text with the goal of getting you to voluntarily share information like your full name, address, and Social Security number. Other scams exist to get your federal student loan login information, which can lead to criminals locking you out of your account completely, stealing your identity or both.\\nThere are companies out there promising loan forgiveness assistance and other types of debt relief in exchange for upfront fees. Unfortunately, they can\u2019t actually deliver on the promise of student loan forgiveness, but they'll still take your money and pretend to help you until you realize it's all a ruse.\\nIt\u2019s important to note that there isn\u2019t anything a private company can do that you cannot do yourself for free. And if you do need help, you can always contact your student loan servicer.\\nThe U.S. Department of Education also says that, in some cases, these companies will ask you to send them your student loan payment so they can pay your bills on your behalf. Of course, they will never make your student loan payments since their whole plan is pocketing your money instead.\\nScams that have to do with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid tend to morph over time, although they typically involve a company promising to help families secure financial aid for higher education. In any case, the scammer is trying to:\\nRegardless of the goal of the scam, the Department of Education says that you should never pay for help with the FAFSA since you can get it for free through the the financial aid office at your college or schools you\u2019re thinking about attending, the FAFSA form\u2019s online help page, or the Federal Student Aid Information Center.\\nThere are some telltale signs that should alert you when something\u2019s not right with a student loan program.

Sen. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Wednesday that Vought would \"be able to hit the ground running.\"\\nHowever, Democrats remained staunchly opposed to Vought's nomination and claimed his views on impoundment disqualified him from the role, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arguing on Wednesday that Trump and Vought believe \"they may be above the law.\"\\nHowever, what is the Impoundment Control Act? Here is a look at what's up for debate regarding government spending \u2014 and what changes could emerge during the Trump administration.\\nArticle I of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to manage the federal budget to determine funding decisions to balance power between the branches of government.\\nHowever, the act of impoundment occurs when the executive branch chooses to not spend these approved dollars from Congress, since the executive branch and the Office of Budget and Management do oversee the actual spending of the approved funds.\\nShould a president want to spend less than what Congress has budgeted, the executive branch must secure approval from Congress. Deferring funds also requires the executive branch to inform Congress.\\nAs a result, Congress passed the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to establish these proper channels of congressional oversight if a president chooses to withhold or defer these funds.\\n\u2018ULTRA-RIGHT\u2019: TRUMP BUDGET CHIEF PICK RUSSELL VOUGHT FACES FIRE FROM DEM SENATORS\\nPresident Donald Trump's nominee for Office of Management and Budget director, Russell Vought, testifies during the Senate Finance Committee nomination hearing in the Dirksen Senate Building on Jan. 22, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\\nVought\u2019s opponents voiced concern that his leadership would lead to more cases like the freeze of federal grants and loans disclosed in an OMB memo on Jan. 27, a move that Democrats say was illegal and violated the Impoundment Control Act.\\n\"As much as Trump desires it, the president is not a king,\" Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told reporters on Jan. 28. \"As much as Trump desires it, a law is not a suggestion.\"\\n\"These are not questions of opinion,\" Merkley said. \"These are principles at the heart of our constitutional system. It's at the heart of our checks and balances, and thus we have a constitutional crisis.\"\\nVought repeatedly defended his stance that the Impoundment Control Act was unconstitutional in multiple confirmation hearings and claimed that presidents historically could spend less than what Congress had earmarked prior to 1974.\\nProponents of executive impoundment frequently point to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s administration in 1803, when Congress appropriated funding for 15 gunboats. However, Jefferson held off on purchasing the boats to not aggravate France amid delicate discussions between then-Secretary of State James Madison and Napoleon. The purchase of the boats eventually became unnecessary following the Louisiana Purchase.\\nAdditionally, Vought\u2019s Center for Renewing America, a nonprofit Vought founded in 2021, has said impoundment allows the executive branch to exert fiscal discipline and that the president has the authority to determine if funds are used in the most efficient manner.\\nVought did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\\nHowever, according to multiple legal experts, the Constitution and the courts are clear that spending appropriations fall under the parameters of the legislative branch.\\nMichael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, told Fox News Digital, \"The president has the constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and that includes spending.\\n\"So I don't know where Mr. Vought gets the view that somehow the president has the right to decide what the government is going to spend money on,\" he said. \"This is Congress' job.\"\\nDespite Trump and Vought\u2019s views that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, McConnell said that he believed there is \"no reasonable prospect that the court is going to agree with that.\\n\"The person who would have been the recipient of the funding will have some standing to sue,\" McConnell said. \"So, I would assume that if there's an impoundment, there will be an immediate lawsuit under the Impoundment Control Act.\"\\nTRUMP TREASURY PICK: EXTENDING TRUMP TAX CUTS \u2018SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ISSUE\u2019\\nRussell Vought repeatedly defended his stance that the Impoundment Control Act was unconstitutional in multiple confirmation hearings. (Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press )\\nOther legal experts agreed that should the Trump administration attempt to withhold funds, the courts would step in and assert that there is no legal basis to do so.\\nThat is because this is not a murky legal issue, according to Georgetown Law professor Stephen Vladeck.\\n\"There are contested issues of constitutional law, but this just isn't one of them,\" Vladeck told Fox News Digital. \"Were it otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in having a legislative branch.\"\\nLegal experts claim the courts historically have upheld the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act, and point to the 1975 case Train v. City of New York. In that case, the Supreme Court determined the Environmental Protection Agency must use full funding included in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, even though then-President Richard Nixon issued orders not to use all the funding.\\nVought himself admitted in a Jan. 22 confirmation hearing that no court of law has found the Impoundment Control Act unconstitutional.\\nThe courts did step into action following the recent OMB memo outlining a pause in federal grants and loans, and two federal judges have temporarily blocked the freeze.\\nAlthough the White House did rescind the memo pausing the federal aid on Jan. 29, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the move did not equate to a \"rescission of the federal funding freeze.\"\\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Vought's nomination and comments from Democrats that the memo was \"illegal.\"\\nThe memo did not appear to alarm Republican leadership in Congress, who publicly characterized the pause as standard protocol during an administrative turnover.\\n\"I think that's a normal practice at the beginning of administration, until they have an opportunity to review how the money is being spent,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters on Jan. 27. \"We'll see kind of what the extent of it is, and \u2026 what they intend to do in a more fulsome way. But for now, I think it's just, it's just kind of a preliminary step that I think most administrations take,\" Thune said.\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also told reporters on Jan. 27 the memo did not concern him and that he \"fully\" supported it, labeling the directive a \"common application of common sense.\"\\nEven so, the memo further intensified opposition to Vought\u2019s nomination. Specifically, Democrats urged the entire Senate to reject Vought\u2019s nomination on Jan. 30 in response, following a committee vote advancing his nomination to the Senate floor.\\nMerkely noted that Vought oversaw the OMB in 2019 when the office held up $214 million in military aid for Ukraine \u2014 an issue that emerged as a key point in Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Ultimately, the Government Accountability Office determined in 2020 the move did violate the Impoundment Control Act, ahead of Trump's Senate impeachment trial. The Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump.\\nTherefore, Merkley characterized Vought as \"dangerously unfit\" to lead OMB and a \"dangerous threat to our constitutional system of representative democracy.\"\\nJosh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, said such language such as \"constitutional crisis\" is reasonable considering Congress\u2019s spending power is one of the few but critical ways the legislative branch ensures the executive branch doesn\u2019t exert too much power.\\n\"These kinds of impoundments are not just unconstitutional, but they're actually anti-constitutional,\" Chafetz told Fox News Digital. \"They strike at the very foundation of our constitutional order.\"\\nDemocrats also don\u2019t believe the recent memo is an isolated incident. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. cautioned on Jan. 30 that Vought would seek to withhold funds again overseeing OMB \u2014 if the Senate confirms him.\\nVought himself signaled the Trump administration could initiate reform on impoundment law. In a confirmation hearing on Jan. 22, Vought told lawmakers that while an exact strategy is not intact yet, the Trump administration plans to complete a review with the Justice Department to explore the \"parameters of the law with regard to the Impoundment Control Act,\" should the Senate confirm him.\\nVought also noted that some lawmakers who agree with his position on impoundment have proposed legislation on the matter. For example, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced legislation in December 2024 to repeal the Impoundment Control Act, arguing that the law\u2019s \"unconstitutional limitations\" on the executive branch have \"contributed to a fiscal crisis.\"\\nGET TO KNOW DONALD TRUMP'S CABINET: WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT PICKED SO FAR?\\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah., previously introduced legislation that would repeal the Impoundment Control Act. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\\nWhile many legal experts agree the legislative branch is the proper channel for reforming the Impoundment Control Act, Chafetz doubts there is an appetite to do so and that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle would ultimately view such attempts as an \"attack on their institution.\"\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\nAs a result, Vladeck said that the Trump administration only has two means to navigate the Impoundment Control Act: either adhere to it or modify it.\\n\"As for what we can expect going forward, it's entirely possible that the administration will try to push the envelope,\" Vladeck said. \"But the onus ought to be on the administration to follow the procedure Congress and the president agreed to in 1974 \u2014 or

["https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/12/23/us-higher-education-is-staring-at-an-uncertain-future-under-trump", "Lean Left", "Rashid Khalidi, America\u2019s foremost scholar on Palestine, best described the sorry state of higher education in the United States today in a recent interview.\\nExplaining his decision to retire from his position as Edward Said chair of modern Arab history at Columbia University, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a cog in that machine any more.\\n\u201cFor some time now, I have been both disgusted and horrified by the way higher education has developed into a cash register \u2013 essentially a money-making, MBA, lawyer-run, hedge fund-cum-real estate operation, with a minor sideline in education, where money has determined everything, where respect for pedagogy is at a minimum\u201d.\\nRegrettably, the situation that pushed Khalidi into what many see as a much too early retirement is likely to get much worse in the near future.\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised to launch an all-out attack on American universities as soon as he returns to the White House.\\nOn the campaign trail, Trump cited the rising tuition fees at colleges and universities. But UPenn-educated Trump placed the blame on \u201cradical Left accreditors\u201d who had allowed universities to be \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d. His running mate, Yale University graduate JD Vance, meanwhile, called university professors the \u201cenemy\u201d and has pledged to \u201chonestly and aggressively attack universities\u201d.\\nThe broad strokes of what this presidency plans to achieve in higher education are already laid out in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s blueprint for a conservative takeover of the state and all its institutions, Project 2025. The project calls for the dismantling of all diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and the rejection and removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d and critical race theory from all teaching material. It underlines the need to prohibit accreditors from requiring educational institutions to adopt DEI policies. It insists on the need to protect faith-based institutions from accreditation agencies\u2019 standards and criteria that they believe \u201cundermine religious beliefs\u201d. Project 2025 also calls for an end to loan forgiveness programs and, eventually, the closing of the Department of Education.\\nTrump may not be able to achieve all this during his upcoming term. But some of his stated plans for higher education are well within reach and will likely be implemented in some form or other within the next year.\\nTrump has promised, for example, to \u201cfire radical left accreditors\u201d and \u201cMarxist diversity, equity, and inclusion bureaucrats\u201d and replace them with those committed to upholding a new set of standards, which include \u201cdefending the American tradition and Western civilization\u201d. While he will likely not be able to change the way higher education accreditation is done in the US in the short term, he could easily create an environment, and pass regulation, that would pressure institutions to move away from DEI initiatives.\\nTo the detriment of minority and marginalised communities\u2019 access to higher education, Trump could easily weaponise the Department of Justice and federal civil rights laws to target institutions that continue with DEI efforts and tax endowment. He could also withhold federal funding to \u201cforce ideological conformity and promote conservative program preferences\u201d at US universities. This would include forcing university leaders to crack down on Palestine solidarity activists or, as Trump puts it, \u201cpro-Hamas radicals\u201d to make college campuses \u201csafe and patriotic again\u201d.\\nTitle IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, will likely be in the eye of the storm as well. Biden-era expansion of the definition of the scope of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation has irked the conservatives. Therefore, the incoming Trump administration can be expected to remove existing protections for LGBTQ+ students and staff at federally funded colleges. Under Title IX, the Biden administration had also boosted \u201csafeguards for victims of campus sexual assault\u201d by expanding the definition of sexual harassment and ending the requirement of live hearings Trump introduced during his first term. Trump is now expected to revert these changes by \u201ctightening the definition of sexual harassment, raising the standard of proof for allegations and [once again] allowing live hearings\u201d.\\nAccess to higher education will also be under attack under Trump. He has publicly deemed federal loan forgiveness programs, and programs aimed at keeping monthly loan payments low and reducing the time it takes to pay off loans as \u201cunlawful and unfair\u201d. His administration is expected to scrap these. Of course, this will mean that millions of low-income and middle-income students would be unable to afford higher education.\\nTrump\u2019s immigration policies and mass deportation plans will also have an effect on higher education. Currently, there are 408,000 undocumented students in higher education institutions in the US. Many states provide these students access to in-state tuition and state financial aid. Only three states prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public colleges. Under Trump, many more public institutions may feel compelled to \u2013 or outright be forced to \u2013 do the same. Trump\u2019s incoming Education Secretary, former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and passionate anti-DEI advocate Linda McMahon, will undoubtedly work hard to turn Trump\u2019s grim vision for American higher education into reality.\\nSome have pledged to push back.\\nIn August, responding to JD Vance\u2019s promise to \u201caggressively attack universities in this country\u201d if elected into office, American Association of University Professors (AAUP) President Todd Wilson said, \u201cWe are in a crucial moment that will decide the future of higher education for decades to come. Colleges and universities are the bedrock of American democracy and the engine of social mobility, innovation, and progress. We can\u2019t allow fascists to strip it away. Now is the time to fight.\u201d\\nAfter the elections, Wilson urged institutions, faculty, staff and students to organise, arguing that the crisis in the sector, with dwindling public funding, rising student debt and increasing attacks on academic freedom, \u201cwill only be intensified\u201d under Trump 2.0.\\nOthers, however, appear to perceive the Trump agenda for higher education as the will of the American people, and seem willing to reach a compromise with an administration openly voicing its desire to reshape the entire sector to fall in line with its ideological preferences.\\nFor example, in a statement after the elections defending DEI efforts and academic freedom at US universities, president of Wesleyan University Michael S Roth also suggested that universities \u201cneed to be willing to listen\u201d to the point of view of Trump/Vance as millions of Americans had \u201cmade their voices heard with their votes [for them]\u201d. Meanwhile, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) \u2013 one of the seven nonprofit accrediting groups in the US that oversees 170 colleges in Hawaii and California \u2013 has already proposed the removal of \u201cdiversity, equality and inclusion\u201d from its accreditation standards. PEN America expressed its concerns regarding the timing of this measure, adding that doing so \u201cin the face of an incoming president who has threatened to \u2018fire the accreditors\u2019 \u2026 cannot help but create the perception that WASC is bowing to political pressure\u201d.\\nThat certain leaders and institutions of American higher education appear to be bowing to Trump even before he officially moves back into the White House should not surprise anyone. Higher education has always been a tool of American soft power, and its institutions have been eagerly serving the agenda of the state \u2013 whatever this agenda may be \u2013 since their very inception. Under Trump, America is poised to reposition itself in the world and restructure its internal dynamics. The incoming administration has made it clear that these grand alterations to \u201cmake America great again\u201d will require a complete revamp of the education system. American universities may not have a choice but to accept their fate and adapt.\\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s

2025, 11:59 am CST\\nImporters and others who want to challenge tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump could argue that he doesn\u2019t have that power\u2014but the argument isn\u2019t a slam dunk, legal experts say. (Photo from Shutterstock)\\nImporters and others who want to challenge tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump could argue that he doesn\u2019t have that power\u2014but the argument isn\u2019t a slam dunk, legal experts say.\\nTrump has cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, a law giving presidents authority to restrict trade in some circumstances, as authority for his power to impose tariffs. At issue is whether the IEEPA gives Trump that power and whether the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d leads to the conclusion that it does not, Bloomberg Law reports.\\nTrump has imposed a 10% tariff on imports from China, but he paused threatened tariffs of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico. Trump said tariffs are needed because of \u201cthe grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs\u201d at the borders, creating a national emergency.\\nUnder the major questions doctrine, Congress must \u201cspeak clearly\u201d when authorizing an executive branch agency to make decisions of vast economic and political significance, wrote Ilya Somin, a professor at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School, at the Volokh Conspiracy. If a statute is ambiguous, the presumption is that the power was not granted.\\nThe major questions doctrine has been \u201creinvigorated\u201d by the U.S. Supreme Court in striking down the federal eviction moratorium and vaccine mandates imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bloomberg Law says.\\nThe Supreme Court also cited the doctrine when it ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency didn\u2019t have broad power to regulate climate change and that the Biden administration didn\u2019t have the power to forgive student loans.\\nSomin argued that imposing \u201cmassive tariffs\u201d is \u201cpretty obviously\u201d a decision with vast economic and political significance with high costs to the public. And the statute under which Trump claimed authority is far from clear, as were the statutes in the student loan and eviction moratorium cases, he wrote.\\nThe IEEPA is a \u201cvague statute\u201d that authorizes presidents to restrict trade when there is \u201cany unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat,\u201d Somin wrote.\\nPeter E. Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, also sees an argument regarding the major questions doctrine, particularly for \u201cuniversal baseline\u201d tariffs imposing a specific percentage charge on all imports.\\n\u201cCourts should find that allowing Trump to waive his magic sharpie to sign an IEEPA executive order imposing tariffs would upset the balance Congress has long sought to strike when it delegates its tariff authority to the president,\u201d he wrote in a Lawfare post.\\nApart from the major questions doctrine, an argument could be made that the plain text of the IEEPA doesn\u2019t give presidents tariff authority, Harrell wrote.\\nArticle 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to set tariffs and regulate commerce with foreign nations. A president\u2019s power to set tariffs comes from delegated authority by Congress, Harrell wrote. The IEEPA gives a president the power to ban or limit exports and imports, but the list \u201cnotably\u201d does not explicitly include the power to impose tariffs or taxes.\\nSaikrishna Prakash, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, told Bloomberg Law that the opposite argument is that the broad powers granted by the law should include the lesser power of imposing tariffs.\\nThe \u201cIEEPA allows a very broad power to ban commerce, and so given that, why can\u2019t the president do something less?\u201d Prakash asks.\\nSomin sees yet another argument that the the nondelegation doctrine applies. It allows broad delegations of power when they are based on an \u201cintelligible principle.\u201d Some Supreme Court justices have expressed interest in \u201ctightening up\u201d the doctrine, and a tariff challenge \u201cmight be a good opportunity to do just that,\u201d he wrote.\\nSomin doesn\u2019t argue that a challenge to tariffs is likely to succeed.\\n\u201cBut the arguments are strong,\u201d he wrote, particularly those in support of the major questions doctrine.", "debra cassens weiss february cst importer want challenge tariff imposed president donald trump argue doe power

<h1>Modeling</h1>
<p>For both datasets, the neural network was ran across a grid with different architecture options. The differences were in the number of layers and number of nodes in the layers. They were all ran with <span class="math inline">\(10,000\)</span> epochs and a learning rate of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.001\)</span>. After the grid search step, the best model was reran to obtain more metrics and examine convergence and overfitting.</p>
<p>The architectures were structured as [input, hidden layer 1, …, hidden layer L, output]:</p>

<li>Architecture 1: [10, 16, 1],</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>News articles published by organizations with known political biases were modeled in an attempt to project political bias on text content when it is unknown. Although political bias can vary between authors and news topics within a single organization, a model which does well with a high amount of complexity was used in this attempt.</p>
<p>A network based model was used used in an attempt to predict the biases of <em>Left</em> or <em>Right</em> categories of an article. Two varieties of the news articles were used. The first variety reduced the news articles from 1000 high frequency words to a few features with a method known for retaining as much information as possible within these features. The second variety used these 1000 high frequency words by counting their appearances in the articles.</p>
<p>In this case, using the reduced features resulted in a moderate prediction accuracy of just above 70%, while the prediction accuracy was just above 90% when using the larger amount of features. Although the process for producing the 90% accuracy model had a higher computational cost, it created robust and effective results.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this was a rather simple version of a network based model. This family of models can be highly efficient at uncovering complex patterns across massive amounts of data. Given more data and further production on the bespoke network model, there is potential for further improvements.</p>
