    "text": "Using the data which has been prepared and merged with potential labels, as seen in Data Acquisition - Reddit, a few more steps can be taken to turn the Reddit posts into numerical representations which can then be used for further analyses and machine learning applications.\n\n\nRecall that the prepared data looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      url\n      title\n      subreddit\n      author\n      original_author\n      author_upvotes\n      author_dates\n      author_content\n      author_content_aggregated\n      replies_to\n      replies_from\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the internet...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs explained in the linked section above, the Reddit text data may be best fit for unsupervised learning methods, thus the labels may not be applicaple. However, potential labels of interest are:\n\nAuthor (Reddit user)\nURL (Reddit Thread)\nSubreddit (Reddit Community)\nSearch (Reddit Search Query)\n\nThe data itself will be the content posted by the Reddit users, or authors. In the inital data above, the column containing every post, comment, and reply by an author on a single Reddit thread was aggregated. This will be the first aggregation schema. A few other aggregation schemas will be considered.\nAggregation Schemas:\n\nThread - Author (INITIAL FORMAT): corpus where each file is an author’s aggregated text within a unique thread.\nSubreddit - Author: corpus where each file is an author’s aggregated text within a unique Subreddit.\nThreads: corpus where each file is the overall aggregated text within unique Threads (author’s combined)\nSubreddits: corpus where each file is the overall aggregated text within unique Subreddits (threads combined).\nAuthors: corpus where each file is the overall aggregated text by authors across every thread.\n\nUsing the initial format for the first schema, some additional preprocessing will take take place for the author’s aggregated posts on a single Reddit thread. This will include:\n\nRemove line breaks.\nRemove punctuation.\nRemove words containing numbers.\nRemove standalone numbers.\nRemove leading and trailing spaces.\nLowercase the remaining words.\nRemove any single-length text remaining.\n\nAs prescribed in the linked section in the Introduction on this page, the author AutoModerator will be removed before proceeding.\n\n\n\nFollowing queues from the Data Vectorizing - NewsAPI page, this initial pass will lemmatize the data and use CountVectorizer() from the scikit-learn library, and compare the different aggregation schemas. The TfidfVectorizer() could be invaluable in later use cases, as the length of the text content for many of the Reddit aggregation schemas vary wildly.\n\nLemmatizing is still a useful data dimensionality reduction technique. However, when it comes to Reddit posts, lemmatizing and especially stemmatizing should be used cautiously. News articles mostly use proper and accepted language, structure, and terms, whereas social media and other online community discussion boards, like Reddit, are likely to follow a more unofficial format. Social media may feature slang, text speak, mispellings, and incomplete sentences. Incomplete sentences could be due to single word responses or reactions, or simply due to improperly structured sentences. Nuances in Reddit-type posts could be lost with cleaning and simplification methods.\n\nAdditionally, stopwords will be removed and 200 maximum features will be used.\n\n\n\nLabeled Sample\n\n\n\n\n

However, potential labels of interest are:\n\nAuthor (Reddit user)\nURL (Reddit Thread)\nSubreddit (Reddit Community)\nSearch (Reddit Search Query)\n\nThe data itself will be the content posted by the Reddit users, or authors. In the inital data above, the column containing every post, comment, and reply by an author on a single Reddit thread was aggregated. This will be the first aggregation schema. A few other aggregation schemas will be considered.\nAggregation Schemas:\n\nThread - Author (INITIAL FORMAT): corpus where each file is an author’s aggregated text within a unique thread.\nSubreddit - Author: corpus where each file is an author’s aggregated text within a unique Subreddit.\nThreads: corpus where each file is the overall aggregated text within unique Threads (author’s combined)\nSubreddits: corpus where each file is the overall aggregated text within unique Subreddits (threads combined).\nAuthors: corpus where each file is the overall aggregated text by authors across every thread.\n\nUsing the initial format for the first schema, some additional preprocessing will take take place for the author’s aggregated posts on a single Reddit thread. This will include:\n\nRemove line breaks.\nRemove punctuation.\nRemove words containing numbers.\nRemove standalone numbers.\nRemove leading and trailing spaces.\nLowercase the remaining words.\nRemove any single-length text remaining.\n\nAs prescribed in the linked section in the Introduction on this page, the author AutoModerator will be removed before proceeding."

    "text": "Following queues from the Data Vectorizing - NewsAPI page, this initial pass will lemmatize the data and use CountVectorizer() from the scikit-learn library, and compare the different aggregation schemas. The TfidfVectorizer() could be invaluable in later use cases, as the length of the text content for many of the Reddit aggregation schemas vary wildly.\n\nLemmatizing is still a useful data dimensionality reduction technique. However, when it comes to Reddit posts, lemmatizing and especially stemmatizing should be used cautiously. News articles mostly use proper and accepted language, structure, and terms, whereas social media and other online community discussion boards, like Reddit, are likely to follow a more unofficial format. Social media may feature slang, text speak, mispellings, and incomplete sentences. Incomplete sentences could be due to single word responses or reactions, or simply due to improperly structured sentences. Nuances in Reddit-type posts could be lost with cleaning and simplification methods.\n\nAdditionally, stopwords will be removed and 200 maximum features will be used."

    "text": "Many were told while growing up something along the lines of “Go to college and you’ll be set.” There was a promise that this would guarantee a certain quality of life along with meaningful, lucrative, and stable opportunities. The assurance made the venture seem like a solid investment in both time and money. For some, foregoing college is simply not an option. However, with the rising cost of higher education, a volatile job market, and current salaries not keeping up with inflation, some who bought into this dream via private and federal loans are having buyer’s remorse. Especially when interest is accounted for, some are even unable to afford their payments at all or may take longer than initially expected [1]. This begs the question, should the U.S. government provide student loan relief? Although this is a complex issue with many factors, there are generally two core views. One side argues “yes” or “does support” while the other argues “no” or “doesn’t support”. The stances are also generally drawn along political party lines, with the left supporting the idea more than the right. In fact, one national poll shows 58% of Democrats were in favor of relief, versus just 15% of Republicans [2].\nHow are news organizations reporting on this? What is the general population saying about this? Given that the dichotomy extends along political lines, are there differences in dialogue between left-leaning and right-leaning entities? Points from both sides of the topic were laid out by Becca Stanek from the Week [2]. Some of the arguments supporting student loan forgiveness were of the cruelty surrounding the structure of student loans, improving economic equity, and that the cost of college and living, even when accounting for inflation, have increased dramatically since the generation before current students and recent graduates. Some of the arguments against the idea were unfairness towards those who have paid off their loans, that it doesn’t address the root problem, and that bulk relief may benefit those who actually do not need the financial aid. Many of those with student loan repayments are overwhelmed by the system and struggling to pursue life goals they thought an education would offer them [3]. These life goals include creating emergency or retirement funds, investing, owning a home, and postponing starting a family. However, many opponents ask the question, “Where does this money come from?” A number of Republicans say that government sponsored plans could “increase the federal budget and tax costs.” There’s an echo of unfairness in increasing taxes on those who don’t have student loans or didn’t even attend college.\nIs there any common ground between the two sides of the arguments? What is the “cruelty” in the system that proponents use as an argument? Similarly, what is the underlying problem in the system that won’t be solved by forgiveness that opponents use an argument? In an article published by NPR, Cory Turner investigates fraudulent colleges. The article claims that for-profit trade schools which serve almost a quarter of federal student loan borrowers account for “44%” of defaults [4]. The author cites examples of Corinthian Colleges, ITT Technical Institute, and DeVry University, whose students have “wasted loans and worthless degrees” and may have been misled by false advertising. In the case of fraud, there seems to be more bilateral support. Fraudulent colleges aside, the cost of education is still rising, “having nearly tripled since 1980”, and the back and forth on forgiveness is frustrating to both sides of the discussion [5]. Although a single cause of this increase is hard to pinpoint, some are blaming the student aid system and the educational institutions themselves. A bulk forgiveness would be costly to taxpayers and even eliminating interest could be damaging. Instead, a recommendation was made to tighten lending requirements and condition borrowing limits on a “degree’s economic returns” and a “borrower’s academic merit.”\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Part of the discussion surrounding Student Loan Forgiveness is reporting done by different news media organizations. These organizations generally align with a certain political bias. With the realization that those on the left tend to support at least some form of student loan relief and those on the right tend to oppose it, it could be fruitful to pair news organizations with their political biases. To achieve this, two main sources of news related data were explored:\n\nNewsAPI\nAllSides\n\n\n\nNewsAPI maintains an application programming interfacae (API) which returns information on articles published around the world. For the scope of this analysis, two search parameters were queried from the API. Articles were gathered using the specific search parameter of student loan forgiveness, as well as a general search parameter of student loans.\nThe data is initially returned in JSON format, which was then turned into a dataframe and subsequently exported into a csv file.\n\n\nSample of the Raw NewsAPI Data\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      author\n      content\n      description\n      date\n      source\n      title\n      url\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the internet...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns:\n\nAuthor: author of the article, sometimes source of the article\nContent: truncated version of the article itself\nDescription: summary of the article\nDate: date the article was published\nSource: news media organization the article was published by\nTitle: the title of the article\nURL: the url of the article on the news media organization source\n\n\n\n\n\nOne limitation of NewsAPI is that it doesn’t return the content of an article in its entirety. To account for this, numerous web scrapers were built for sources which were both scraping-eligible and appropriate for this analysis. This did reduce the number of sources and articles in the data from NewsAPI, but did result in complete article content. A list of eligible sources and their related scrapers were iteratively called to populate a dataframe with the individual paragraphs from the url associated with the article. Procedurally, the initial scrape through will result in a dataframe where each paragraph from each scrapable article will have its own row.\n\n\nSample of the Raw Scraped Data\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      source\n      url\n      paragraph\n      paragraph_num\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the internet...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove shows a random sample of 5 rows after the scraping.

Reddit consists of communities known as Subreddits, where users can participate in topic specific online discourse. Although some users choose to tag their accounts with political bias leanings such as liberal or conservative which could help determine sentiment on certain topics, this isn’t prevalent enough to use as a proper label. However, different sentiments and biases could be found for individual users and Subreddits. Additionally, interesting associations and networks could be formed between the users and communities.\n\nNote that the terms “Reddit Users”, “Reddit Usernames”, and “Reddit Authors” will be used synonymously throughout this analysis.\n\n\n\nTo obtain the data from Reddit, web scraping and an API was utilized. A web scraping function was built which mimics a general search within the Reddit platform and returns the URLs for threads on a given search query. The URLs were then iterated through with the API, which returned the posts, comments, replies, and other supporting information.\nThree search queries were made:\n\nStudent Loan Forgiveness\nStudent Loans\nIs a College Degree Worth It\n\nHowever, Is a College Degree Worth It data may not be utilized, as it’s not as precise to the topic of this analysis.\nSpecific objects and tags were created with API calls, and ultimately returned as a dataframe.\nSample of the Raw Reddit Data\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      url\n      title\n      original\n      self\n      post_date\n      comments\n      author\n      id\n      upvotes\n      content\n      comment_date\n      replying_to\n      subreddit\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the internet...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main cleaning that was required was for the content; posts, comments, and replies. The following processing occurred:\n\nIf the first post on a thread returned blank, this likely indicated a link to an outside source. In this case, the title was used as the content.\nValues within the content strings such as line breaks and reply indicators were removed.\nEmail addresses and links were removed.\nEmojis and other non-ASCII characters were removed.\nDuplicate posts were common and were removed.\n\n\nThis initial cleaning step still left the individual posts, comments, or replies as rows themselves.\n\nGiven that quite a few rows of content could be a few words, or even a single word reply, the idea for the next processing step was to have content from each author for each thread aggregated together. Additionally, data maps were created to track communications between authors. For each thread, the following restructuring was performed for a given author:\n\nLists:\n\nUpvotes (can be positive or negative)\nPosting Dates\nContent (posts, comments, and replies)\nReplies To (who the author has replied to)\nReplies From (who responded to the author)\n\nValues for Specific Threads:\n\nURL\nTitle\nSubreddit\nAuthor (Reddit username)\nOriginal Author (boolean for if the author started the thread - made the original post)\n\n\nA sample of the Restructured Reddit data\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      url\n      title\n      subreddit\n      author\n      original_author\n      author_upvotes\n      author_dates\n      author_content\n      author_content_aggregated\n      replies_to\n      replies_from\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the internet...\n(need help?)"

In this case, the title was used as the content.\nValues within the content strings such as line breaks and reply indicators were removed.\nEmail addresses and links were removed.\nEmojis and other non-ASCII characters were removed.\nDuplicate posts were common and were removed.\n\n\nThis initial cleaning step still left the individual posts, comments, or replies as rows themselves.\n\nGiven that quite a few rows of content could be a few words, or even a single word reply, the idea for the next processing step was to have content from each author for each thread aggregated together.

Although many authors only had a single appearance, there were a few who frequently post in these Reddit topic-specific communities. One user is actually a Reddit sanctioned bot, known as a Moderator, which helps to control inappropriate or misplaced discussion. This bot, AutoModerator, has its post shown in orange above and will be removed in the subsequent analyses."

Namely, word count dataframes will be created using CountVectorizer() and normalized word count dataframes will be created using TfidfVectorizer(), both from scikit-learn. Stopwords will be removed using these functions as well. Dataframes will be further subsetted along the political bias labels. Lemmatizing and Stemming will also be used to create different versions available for further analyses. One additional option could be further versions of maximum words allowed in a dataframe.\n\n\n\nThese versions will vectorize the completely preprocessed NewsAPI data in its entirety, remove stopwords and use a maximum of 200 features. A sample of the datasets for both vectorized versions will be shown.

For instance, students are aggregated into student and loans into loan, while words like education are not reduced to something like educ. Moving forward, lemmatizing is a logical preprocessing step. Thus, lemmatization and stopwords removal for creating vectorized versions of the political bias will be used. For the process of creating subsets of the political bias data, there are two methods that could be used.\n\nSubsetting Second: vectorize the entire dataset \\(\\rightarrow\\) append labels \\(\\rightarrow\\) subset on political bias\nSubsetting First: subset the dataset on political bias \\(\\rightarrow\\) vectorize the subset \\(\\rightarrow\\) append labels\n\nBy subsetting first, the maximum word count will be reflective of the corpus associated with the respective political bias. Therefore, it might be more useful in this comparative analysis to subset first.\nAdditionally, CountVectorizer() will be used over TfidfVectorizer() for a first pass. A normalized version of the features could be useful in some cases, such as when dealing with varying sizes of content (i.e. total word count of content), but feature appearance counts will be more useful for visualizing in this analysis.\n\n\nLabeled Sample\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      source\n      author\n      Bias Specific\n      Bias Numeric\n      date\n      search\n      able\n

Namely, word count dataframes will be created using CountVectorizer() and normalized word count dataframes will be created using TfidfVectorizer(), both from scikit-learn. Stopwords will be removed using these functions as well. Dataframes will be further subsetted along the political bias labels. Lemmatizing and Stemming will also be used to create different versions available for further analyses. One additional option could be further versions of maximum words allowed in a dataframe."

    "text": "Lemmatizing seems to aggregate the text data while retaining meaning in the words. For instance, students are aggregated into student and loans into loan, while words like education are not reduced to something like educ. Moving forward, lemmatizing is a logical preprocessing step. Thus, lemmatization and stopwords removal for creating vectorized versions of the political bias will be used. For the process of creating subsets of the political bias data, there are two methods that could be used.\n\nSubsetting Second: vectorize the entire dataset \\(\\rightarrow\\) append labels \\(\\rightarrow\\) subset on political bias\nSubsetting First: subset the dataset on political bias \\(\\rightarrow\\) vectorize the subset \\(\\rightarrow\\) append labels\n\nBy subsetting first, the maximum word count will be reflective of the corpus associated with the respective political bias. Therefore, it might be more useful in this comparative analysis to subset first.\nAdditionally, CountVectorizer() will be used over TfidfVectorizer() for a first pass. A normalized version of the features could be useful in some cases, such as when dealing with varying sizes of content (i.e. total word count of content), but feature appearance counts will be more useful for visualizing in this analysis.\n\n\nLabeled Sample\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      source\n      author\n      Bias Specific\n      Bias Numeric\n      date\n      search\n      able\n
