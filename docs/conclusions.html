<p>As the cost of college is outpacing inflation and young adults with unproven financial literacy are given loans to cover their educational expenses, a debt crisis is occurring within the United States for those in pursuit of higher education. At any given time, “an average 8.15 percent of student loan debt” across the nation is in default <span class="citation" data-cites="newsweek_garnishment">[<a href="#ref-newsweek_garnishment" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>. Many are struggling to keep up with their monthly payments or are facing decades to pay off their debt once interest is accounted for <span class="citation" data-cites="opencampusLikeDrowning">[<a href="#ref-opencampusLikeDrowning" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>. There is a political divide on whether student loans should be forgiven by the federal government. In fact, one national poll shows 58% of Democrats were in favor of relief, versus just 15% of Republicans <span class="citation" data-cites="theweekProsCons">[<a href="#ref-theweekProsCons" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>. In other words, those with the political bias of Left general support student loan forgiveness while those with the political bias of Right general oppose student loan forgiveness. In support of the idea, many say the burden of debt delays life milestones and brings significant financial struggles. In opposition to the idea, many say it would result in increased federal taxes and doesn’t address the root issue. Those in support argue the system is unjust while those in opposition argue that increased federal taxes are unfair towards those in good standing with their repayments and to those who didn’t pursue higher education. To better investigate the conversations surrounding this controversy, news articles and reddit conversation were gathered with appropriate queries and preapred for analysis.</p>
<p>Online social discourse, such as Reddit conversations, can color outside of the political divide that entities such as politicians or news media organization generally adhere to must strictly abide by. Effectively, this offers a glimpse into the public’s real sentiment towards topics. However, from the perspective of comparing news articles to Reddit conversations, there are limitations stemming from syntactical and structural nuances. News articles mostly use proper and accepted language, structure, and terms, whereas social media and other online community discussion boards, like Reddit, are likely to follow a more unofficial format. Social media may feature slang, text speak, misspellings, and incomplete sentences. Incomplete sentences could be due to single word responses or reactions, or simply due to improperly structured sentences. One result from the analysis illustrated these differences can propagate when comparing news articles and online social discourse. In an attempt to identify political biases within Subreddits, vetted news articles were chosen and combined into a corpus with content aggregated by Subreddits. The chosen news articles were known to cluster together within political biases and apart between political biases. &gt;The theory being that clusters formed from this corpus could help identify political bias of the Subreddits. In essence, Subreddits which clustered with a particular group of news articles could indicate similar bias or sentiment towards the topic.</p>
<p>However, the result ultimately revealed that the Reddit conversations were simply different than the news articles.</p>

<p>Given that sentiment towards this topic is roughly divided along political lines, frequent words from subsets of news median organization with known political bias were examined.</p>

<p>In these images, the higher frequency words are larger. There are shared words between the amalgamations of political biases, however some are more prevalent than others. Articles from news organizations more associated with the Left seem to focus on student loans with an education and temporal component. Articles from the Center associated organizations seem to focus on student loans with heavy reference to borrowers. Articles from the Right associated organizations seem to mention President Biden and President Trump, potentially more focused on their contrasting agendas on student loan forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After some of the groundwork was laid by exploratory data analysis, modeling was performed with the intent of predicting political bias for any given news article. The models were used to either predict three biases (Left, Center, or Right) or the two most polar biases (Left or Right).</p>

<p>For both the three and two bias class models, there was enough information available to decently teach the models how to partition between the biases, as confirmed by high accuracies. Notably, models across several families of machine learning models perform phenomenally for most divisive binary bias class models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a model known for its ability to produce a tree-like flowchart was implemented during this process. Not only did this model achieve an adequate accuracy of just above 80% on predicting the binary bias class models of Left vs.&nbsp;Right, but it simplified the logic of selection with just a handful of word counts (out of the thousands available across the vocabulary of just these news articles) from any given article.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>From top to bottom, the logical flow of splitting by words by their counts in articles can followed, with almost 80% in predicting political bias of a news article. For example, the root node roughly illustrates that if the word “news” appears more or less than 3 times in an article, there is enough information gained to split the article into the next set of leaves. When false (3 or more counts), the bias of Right was given into an almost pure split of 2 Left articles and 64 Right articles. By following the pathways to the final leaves in the tree, this maximizes the information-based potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data for both the news articles and Reddit conversations were also examined regardless of political bias with a technique known as topic modeling. In general, a topic is a mixture of words, and a document is a mixture of topics. In this case, one set of documents is the news articles, and the other set of documents is Reddit authors’ aggregated content. Topic modeling aims to uncover the layered similarities. The specific technique used doesn’t return topics, but topics can be deduced by logically examining the words.</p>
<p><strong>Topic Modeling - News Articles</strong></p>

</div>
<p>By examining the words and their relative frequency (weight) within the unlabeled topic, a topic can roughly be deduced. There appears to be three main themes within the data collected:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finance</strong></li>
<li><strong>Government</strong></li>
<li><strong>Education</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Given that the overall subject and search queries were for student loan forgiveness, which references the government helping to financially assist students, these were appropriate. Although this isn’t a substantial discovery, it does affirm suitable content was collected.</p>
<p>One of the overarching goals of this research was to investigate if and how sentiment – positive or negative attitude – can be projected onto public discourse. It’s been proven that the political bias of news articles can be effectively modeled. Even though news articles and Reddit conversations have their innate language structure differences, the success of the models on news articles provide another chance of bias discovery on the social discourse platform. These more adept models were applied to the Reddit discussions to potentially uncover patterns in political bias, and ultimately sentiment.</p>
<p>Since sentiment on the topic tends to divide along political lines, analyzing Reddit authors’ political leanings provides a new way to track sentiment. In using the models to classify political bias, positive and negative sentiment scores can be applied to their writing. This offers a structured and quantitative method to examine sentiment towards the topic.</p>

<p>The gauges above illustrate the two most extreme Author scores on either side of the sentiment. The authors with usernames <em>-CJF-</em> and <em>horsebycommittee</em> represent the extremes of Positive and Negative sentiment, respectively.</p>
<p>To examine how this theory truly performed, given the unlabeled experimental nature of the method, a few of the authors’ posts will be illustrated.</p>

It was made by people and has no inherit truth. What is legal and what is not is subjective in many cases. Student loan forgiveness is one such case. Roe v Wade is another. See the Dobbs decision and compare that to the prior Roe v. Wade ruling. They're inconsistent and incompatible because the justices hearing the case had different ideologies and personal beliefs."], ["Forgiveness? Yes. I do still have some hope for the SAVE plan, just because overturning it would be such a wild stretch of the law."], ["This bill is terrible and if they do manage to pass it via reconciliation Democrats would surely undo it via reconciliation as soon as they retake the majority."], ["Where is the Protecting Taxpayers from Wealthy Business Bailouts Act?By the way, if Biden's actions surrounding student loan forgiveness were illegal, why does Congress need to pass a bill forbidding it...?"], ["It's not just student loans.Republicans are against so many safety net programs...SNAP and Medicaid, broadband and communication benefits, the Affordable Care Act protections for healthcare, etc. As bad as it was to give Trump the presidency I'm surprised voters would give republicans full control of government. They are going to make all of our lives more difficult.On the plus side,I think people will have massive buyers remorse by the midterms. Unfortunately a lot of damage can be done in two years with no checks or balances."], ["At this point I just hope the IDR adjustment hits before the new administration takes charge, otherwise I will lose years of payment history. Then after SAVE falls I will go back to IBR."], ["If Trump did it, it would be funny to watch it suddenly become lawful. But alas, doing this would require motivation to help people, which unfortunately just isn't there."], ["It's a nice thought. I hope you're right."], ["I'm still waiting on the one-time account adjustment to hit. What are they waiting for? If this drags on into Trump administration I have zero confidence we will ever see it. Regardless of how anyone feels about student loan forgiveness, we should all at least be able to agree that restarting IDR payment counts from zero is completely and totally unfair."], ["Sounds like concepts of a plan with no implementation. I'm seeing a pattern on the right."], ["For what it's worth, I'm about as pessimistic about republican policy as possible and I don't think IBR is getting changed. I wouldn't worry about that."], ["Trump's plan to deport 20 million migrants via executive orders is estimated to cost upwards of a trillion dollars. It will be interesting to see if it faces any lawsuits and how SCOTUS responds to that with their *Major Questions Doctrine* or if we'll just see blind partisan hypocrisy."], ["There is only one IBR plan (Income-Based Repayment). You are likely referring to IDR (Income-Driven Repayment) which is terminology that comprises all of the plans based on income such as PAYE, REPAYE, SAVE, IBR, etc. I agree with your assessment that a Trump Department of Education will not process any IDR forgiveness.Even in the worst case I think IBR will survive in some form. Republicans had proposed changes to IBR that remove the forgiveness at the end but add an interest subsidy. However, it would have to pass Congress. I don't think that will happen. The more likely scenario is IBR stays as is, SAVE (and possibly PAYE, REPAYE and portions of ICR) all go down with the lawsuit and no forgiveness at all gets processed under Trump.Just my 2c."], ["This article is wrong that the lower interest rate wouldn't help people on income-driven plans. Those plans still accumulate interest at whatever rate you borrowed at, even if you have a $0 per month payment, so it would help.I think democrats would be on board with this if it's a clean bill with nothing else in it but I'm not sure how many Republicans would support it."], ["More than likely, or it just won't have enough support from other Republicans and will flop. I hope I'm wrong."], ["I agree with that and more, but with Republicans in charge we would be really lucky to get anything and 1% would definitely help a lot."]];

It's likely that the changes brought about by the SAVE plan regulations and other regulations that have made forgiveness easier over the past four years will be rolled back in some way. But we don't know in what way, or what those changes would mean for any given borrower. We also don't know what, if any, actions the incumbent Administration will take in the next few weeks, before they leave office.Changes may also depend on whether Republicans control the House or not (they are already projected to win Senate control). As of the time of this post, that is also unknown.All of the above are fair game to discuss in this thread (consistent with the regular rules of the sub -- esp. Rule 7) as is speculation about what new/different student loan policies the new Trump Administration or Congress may implement, beyond merely undoing Biden Administration rules."], ["\"Getting rid of ED\" is a misleading promise, at best. Even if the Department stopped issuing new direct loans and Pell Grants, the government would still own and need to service the existing debts for many years. (And ED does much, much more than just student aid -- those other functions would also need to be wound down over many years or transferred to other departments, meaning that ED would sort of \"move\" not disappear.) This would also require an act of Congress; presidents can't eliminate agencies on their own.If we assume that a law is passed and ED instantly stops issuing new Federal Student Aid money (grants, work-study, and loans), then there would be chaos in higher education. Many current students would need to drop out because they could not afford the price without aid. Other students might be able to transfer to cheaper schools, but for a lower-quality education. There would be significant pressure on schools to lower costs to what students could afford, though at the expense of quality. Some of the most expensive schools would not have to adjust much, however, since they already cater to wealthier students and have massive endowments built upon historical wealth. Harvard and Yale will be fine. But anyone who needs aid to attend a top-tier university will not be -- we'll return to a pre-1970s-ish time when college is only available to students whose families can and will help them financially to do so and it's not an option for everyone else.Private lenders will still be involved in the market, but that industry is not equipped to offset new loans that the government originates every year ([$75,556,035,663 in 2023-24]( and all of the current ills and risks of private student loans would remain. Some students would go for them, but it would still be largely those students whose families are financially secure enough to co-sign. The big policy idea of federal student loans was that the government would take on the risk of default, which would then open doors for lower-income students to succeed. Private lenders weren't taking that risk before and still won't today, effectively barring millions of Americans from higher education solely because they didn't grow up rich enough."], ["Private student loans can also be discharged in bankruptcy. Though I expect you'll have significant difficulty getting a personal loan to refinance your student loan if the amount is at all substantial.You'd also lose the few perks available for private student loans, like the tax deduction on student loan interest and tax-free employer student loan repayment."], ["If the moneys wiped they can't reinstate irSUPREME COURT (bursting through the wall like the Kool Aid man): *We* decide what the president can't do!"], ["A court can't \"unvaccinate\" someone who has already gotten the jab. A court *could* say \"you still owe this money even though someone else said you don't.\""], ["i personally dont think they can get rid of things like saveGiven that all of SAVE has already been blocked by multiple court orders, this is one of the *easier* things an incoming administration could do. All that would need to happen is the new Department of Justice would dismiss its current appeals defending SAVE. The lower courts would then make their orders blocking the plan effective permanently and SAVE would be gone.Now, the SAVE regulation did a *lot* more than just create SAVE. And SAVE itself wasn't a new plan, it was revised rules for the existing REPAYE plan. So the specifics of what those court orders would do is uncertain -- would only the SAVE parts be blocked, or the entire regulation? Would SAVE revert to the old REPAYE rules or would REPAYE and SAVE both completely disappear? What would that mean for borrowers already on SAVE?We don't know, but I suspect that we're going to find out."], ["At the moment, we don't know what \"adjustments\" the new Trump Administration will try to do. For something like undoing a Biden Administration policy that was implemented through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, the new Admin could just repeal it the same way, with a new notice-and-comment rule.More significant changes might require Congressional action or be blocked by courts, but it really depends on what the change is. It's usually much easier and simpler to revert to a prior system (even if it's broken) than to fix the system."], ["Depends on how you define \"screwed\" I guess. I would expect there to be fewer avenues to getting forms of relief or forgiveness; and the paths that remain will likely be administratively harder to access.But it's not like the Administration can make your loans *worse* -- they're still governed by the contract you signed (the MPN). Your interest rate won't *increase* or anything crazy like that."]];

<p>The user on the extreme positive side of sentiment is certainly hoping for some sort of relief to pass, as well as exhibiting negative sentiment towards Republicans (or the right). The user on the extreme negative side of sentiment isn’t exactly championing Republicans or the elimination of any plans, but they’re echoing rhetoric of the Right in how the plans were flawed to begin with along with the Right’s outlines on their agenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This method is not without its flaws, but it begins to capture deeper complexities within sentiment on such a divisive issue. Although there is the principal component of political division, other auxiliary components such as distrust in leaders and inequity emerge when analyzing social discourse. From Occam’s Razor perspective, perhaps projecting sentiment from political bias on a model efficient for a different type of media is a few steps too far.</p>
<p>The United States is renowned for its educational institutions, but there is a true crisis occurring. Universities can partially implement attractive enhancements due to knowing students will be able to cover increased costs through easily obtainable loans. This has created a feedback loop where tuition has significantly outpaced inflation <span class="citation" data-cites="causes_effects_econ_online">[<a href="#ref-causes_effects_econ_online" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>. Not only is this an issue for millions when the bill comes due, but it is also becoming unappealing to those who don’t wish to be burdened by the debt. Although higher education isn’t the pathway for everyone, should it only become obtainable for the few? Continued dialogue must continue to find sustainable solutions and analyzing how different media outlets along with the sentiment on social discourse platforms can help achieve a shared goal of increased accessibility to higher education.</p>
