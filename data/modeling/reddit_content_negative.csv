It's likely that the changes brought about by the SAVE plan regulations and other regulations that have made forgiveness easier over the past four years will be rolled back in some way. But we don't know in what way, or what those changes would mean for any given borrower. We also don't know what, if any, actions the incumbent Administration will take in the next few weeks, before they leave office.Changes may also depend on whether Republicans control the House or not (they are already projected to win Senate control). As of the time of this post, that is also unknown.All of the above are fair game to discuss in this thread (consistent with the regular rules of the sub -- esp. Rule 7) as is speculation about what new/different student loan policies the new Trump Administration or Congress may implement, beyond merely undoing Biden Administration rules. ""Getting rid of ED"" is a misleading promise, at best. Even if the Department stopped issuing new direct loans and Pell Grants, the government would still own and need to service the existing debts for many years. (And ED does much, much more than just student aid -- those other functions would also need to be wound down over many years or transferred to other departments, meaning that ED would sort of ""move"" not disappear.) This would also require an act of Congress; presidents can't eliminate agencies on their own.If we assume that a law is passed and ED instantly stops issuing new Federal Student Aid money (grants, work-study, and loans), then there would be chaos in higher education. Many current students would need to drop out because they could not afford the price without aid. Other students might be able to transfer to cheaper schools, but for a lower-quality education. There would be significant pressure on schools to lower costs to what students could afford, though at the expense of quality. Some of the most expensive schools would not have to adjust much, however, since they already cater to wealthier students and have massive endowments built upon historical wealth. Harvard and Yale will be fine. But anyone who needs aid to attend a top-tier university will not be -- we'll return to a pre-1970s-ish time when college is only available to students whose families can and will help them financially to do so and it's not an option for everyone else.Private lenders will still be involved in the market, but that industry is not equipped to offset new loans that the government originates every year ([$75,556,035,663 in 2023-24]( and all of the current ills and risks of private student loans would remain. Some students would go for them, but it would still be largely those students whose families are financially secure enough to co-sign. The big policy idea of federal student loans was that the government would take on the risk of default, which would then open doors for lower-income students to succeed. Private lenders weren't taking that risk before and still won't today, effectively barring millions of Americans from higher education solely because they didn't grow up rich enough. Private student loans can also be discharged in bankruptcy. Though I expect you'll have significant difficulty getting a personal loan to refinance your student loan if the amount is at all substantial.You'd also lose the few perks available for private student loans, like the tax deduction on student loan interest and tax-free employer student loan repayment. If the moneys wiped they can't reinstate irSUPREME COURT (bursting through the wall like the Kool Aid man): *We* decide what the president can't do! A court can't ""unvaccinate"" someone who has already gotten the jab. A court *could* say ""you still owe this money even though someone else said you don't."" i personally dont think they can get rid of things like saveGiven that all of SAVE has already been blocked by multiple court orders, this is one of the *easier* things an incoming administration could do. All that would need to happen is the new Department of Justice would dismiss its current appeals defending SAVE. The lower courts would then make their orders blocking the plan effective permanently and SAVE would be gone.Now, the SAVE regulation did a *lot* more than just create SAVE. And SAVE itself wasn't a new plan, it was revised rules for the existing REPAYE plan. So the specifics of what those court orders would do is uncertain -- would only the SAVE parts be blocked, or the entire regulation? Would SAVE revert to the old REPAYE rules or would REPAYE and SAVE both completely disappear? What would that mean for borrowers already on SAVE?We don't know, but I suspect that we're going to find out. At the moment, we don't know what ""adjustments"" the new Trump Administration will try to do. For something like undoing a Biden Administration policy that was implemented through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, the new Admin could just repeal it the same way, with a new notice-and-comment rule.More significant changes might require Congressional action or be blocked by courts, but it really depends on what the change is. It's usually much easier and simpler to revert to a prior system (even if it's broken) than to fix the system. Depends on how you define ""screwed"" I guess. I would expect there to be fewer avenues to getting forms of relief or forgiveness; and the paths that remain will likely be administratively harder to access.But it's not like the Administration can make your loans *worse* -- they're still governed by the contract you signed (the MPN). Your interest rate won't *increase* or anything crazy like that."

They dont even know what they are fighting against.Biden-Harris Administration Approves Additional $4.28 Billion in Student Debt Relief for Nearly 55,000 Public Service WorkersLatest action brings approved relief to almost $180 billion for 4.9 million borrowersThe Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $4.28 billion in additional student loan relief for 54,900 borrowers across the country who work in public service. This relief--which is the result of significant fixes that the Administration has made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program--brings the total loan forgiveness by the Administration to approximately $180 billion for nearly five million Americans, including $78 billion for 1,062,870 borrowers through PSLF. ""Four years ago, the Biden-Harris Administration made a pledge to America's teachers, service members, nurses, first responders, and other public servants that we would fix the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and I'm proud to say that we delivered,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""With the approval of another $4.28 billion in loan forgiveness for nearly 55,000 public servants, the Administration has secured nearly $180 billion in life-changing student debt relief for nearly five million borrowers. The U.S. Department of Education's successful transformation of the PSLF Program is a testament to what's possible when you have leaders, like President Biden and Vice President Harris, who are relentlessly and unapologetically focused on making government deliver for everyday working people."" The PSLF Program provides an incentive for Americans to pursue and remain in careers in education, public health, law enforcement, emergency response, and other critical public service fields by forgiving borrowers' remaining student loan balance after they have made the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. The relief announced today includes both borrowers who have benefitted from the Administration's limited PSLF waiver, a temporary opportunity that ended in October 2022, as well as from regulatory improvements made to the program during this Administration. In addition to these fixes to PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration also implemented further improvements to PSLF to make it easier for borrowers to participate in the program. As of July 2024, the PSLF Program is now fully managed by the Department via StudentAid.gov, rather than by a single loan servicer, making it easier for borrowers to track their progress toward forgiveness. An Unparalleled Record of Support for Federal Student Loan Borrowers Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to helping borrowers who have struggled with the burden of student loan debt. Over the past four years, the Administration has approved nearly $180 billion in student debt relief for 4.9 million borrowers through various actions, taking historic steps to aid hardworking Americans across the country who have worked to repay their student loans but remained in debt. In total, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved:$56.5 billion for more than 1.4 million borrowers through Income-Driven Repayment, including the Saving on a Valuable Education SAVE plan. This includes administrative adjustments to income-driven repayment that brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding problems due to past inaccuracies and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $16.2 billion for almost 572,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.In addition to ensuring that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families, the Administration also secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant--the largest increase in a decade--and finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts and insufficient earnings.[source. this is debt forgiveness for people who are in shit paying jobs teaching kids, police, firefighters, nurses, doctors working for government ]( other public works people, road crew guy at DoT, and so on...."
wes7946,0.0,2.3208889439140163,-2.3208889439140163,Negative,"The federal government largely nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 via a piece of legislation related to Obamacare, the ""Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010."" The US government now holds 92 percent of all student loans - and the nation's [total student debt]( has more than doubled, from $811 billion in April 2010 to $1.751 trillion.Part of the reason the figures have surged - and students start life so indebted - is due to income-based repayment policies that made it impossible for most people to ever pay off their student loans. In their haste to have the US taxpayer underwrite the maximum amount of college tuition, they transformed most student loans from a fixed-rate loan - like a mortgage or car loan - to a plan based on the student's post-graduation income. Gradually, the borrower's share of his college loans shrank, while the taxpayer's increased. These policies made student loan debt effectively permanent and unpayable.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) spelled out the process in[a thorough, February 2020 report]( CBO researchers followed college graduates who began paying off student loans in 2012. ""By the end of 2017, over 75% of those borrowers owed more than they had originally borrowed. By contrast, the median balance among borrowers in fixed-payment plans decreased steadily,"" they noted. ""Loans are often repaid more slowly under income-driven plans because the required payments are too small to cover the accruing interest. As a result, borrowers in such plans typically see their balance grow over time rather than being paid down.""The federal government took over nearly all student loans, forced students to make years of payments only to fall further behind, then handed the enlarged debt to the US taxpayer. To add insult to injury, the federal government also made it all-but impossible to discharge student loans in bankruptcy, ensuring that graduates' hopelessly accumulating loan payments went on endlessly - and that college administrators continued to collect.The majority of student loans are now income-based according to the CBO, and the loans the government would issue between 2020 and 2029 will cost taxpayers an estimated $82.9 billion. All this ignores the fact that Uncle Sam has proved a poor accountant. [A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report ]( released in July 2022 found the Department of Education predicted that student loans would generate $114 billion for the federal government; they instead lost $197 billion - [a $311 billion error]( mostly due to incorrect analysis.Is it possible that this is the next step for government-funded college? This is the result of an income-based repayment plan. The banks secretly, but not so secretly, want those with student loans to go on these types of plans knowing the payments will really only cover the accrued interest every month thereby creating a lifelong asset out of the borrower."

Because the Republicans that control the house wouldn't vote to pass that bill, and you need Congress to actually pass a law for that to happen. Biden has been trying to pass student loan forgiveness without congress because Congress wouldn't pass anything like that. That's what I'm doing. I got one with a 3% interest rate on general categories. I get stuff with and I always budget so I never spend above what I have and just pay it off each month."
