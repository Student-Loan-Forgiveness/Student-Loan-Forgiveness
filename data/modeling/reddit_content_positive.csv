-CJF-,2.6782843825415314,0.0,2.6782843825415314,Positive,"PPP loans were passed by legislation and designed to be forgiven if used properly, but [Trump removed the oversight]( which was shady at best.It's important to remember the field of law is a creation. It was made by people and has no inherit truth. What is legal and what is not is subjective in many cases. Student loan forgiveness is one such case. Roe v Wade is another. See the Dobbs decision and compare that to the prior Roe v. Wade ruling. They're inconsistent and incompatible because the justices hearing the case had different ideologies and personal beliefs. Forgiveness? Yes. I do still have some hope for the SAVE plan, just because overturning it would be such a wild stretch of the law. This bill is terrible and if they do manage to pass it via reconciliation Democrats would surely undo it via reconciliation as soon as they retake the majority. Where is the Protecting Taxpayers from Wealthy Business Bailouts Act?By the way, if Biden's actions surrounding student loan forgiveness were illegal, why does Congress need to pass a bill forbidding it...? It's not just student loans.Republicans are against so many safety net programs...SNAP and Medicaid, broadband and communication benefits, the Affordable Care Act protections for healthcare, etc. As bad as it was to give Trump the presidency I'm surprised voters would give republicans full control of government. They are going to make all of our lives more difficult.On the plus side,I think people will have massive buyers remorse by the midterms. Unfortunately a lot of damage can be done in two years with no checks or balances. At this point I just hope the IDR adjustment hits before the new administration takes charge, otherwise I will lose years of payment history. Then after SAVE falls I will go back to IBR. If Trump did it, it would be funny to watch it suddenly become lawful. But alas, doing this would require motivation to help people, which unfortunately just isn't there. It's a nice thought. I hope you're right. I'm still waiting on the one-time account adjustment to hit. What are they waiting for? If this drags on into Trump administration I have zero confidence we will ever see it. Regardless of how anyone feels about student loan forgiveness, we should all at least be able to agree that restarting IDR payment counts from zero is completely and totally unfair. Sounds like concepts of a plan with no implementation. I'm seeing a pattern on the right. For what it's worth, I'm about as pessimistic about republican policy as possible and I don't think IBR is getting changed. I wouldn't worry about that. Trump's plan to deport 20 million migrants via executive orders is estimated to cost upwards of a trillion dollars. It will be interesting to see if it faces any lawsuits and how SCOTUS responds to that with their *Major Questions Doctrine* or if we'll just see blind partisan hypocrisy. There is only one IBR plan (Income-Based Repayment). You are likely referring to IDR (Income-Driven Repayment) which is terminology that comprises all of the plans based on income such as PAYE, REPAYE, SAVE, IBR, etc. I agree with your assessment that a Trump Department of Education will not process any IDR forgiveness.Even in the worst case I think IBR will survive in some form. Republicans had proposed changes to IBR that remove the forgiveness at the end but add an interest subsidy. However, it would have to pass Congress. I don't think that will happen. The more likely scenario is IBR stays as is, SAVE (and possibly PAYE, REPAYE and portions of ICR) all go down with the lawsuit and no forgiveness at all gets processed under Trump.Just my 2c. This article is wrong that the lower interest rate wouldn't help people on income-driven plans. Those plans still accumulate interest at whatever rate you borrowed at, even if you have a $0 per month payment, so it would help.I think democrats would be on board with this if it's a clean bill with nothing else in it but I'm not sure how many Republicans would support it. More than likely, or it just won't have enough support from other Republicans and will flop. I hope I'm wrong. I agree with that and more, but with Republicans in charge we would be really lucky to get anything and 1% would definitely help a lot."

Finally, there was something that could help prevent the ballooning balances and they had to go and sue because can't have average Americans benefiting from anything. States could start funding them better. There may be some aspects colleges could cut down on, but the majority of the reason for tuition increases is the slashing of state funding. They've been slashing funding since the 80s. Republican messaging pretends it's just game rooms and football fields, but in most cases, it's cuts to state funding so students have to bear more of tuition. Even if it were to pass, it would apply to new borrowers. Getting rid of all plans that most of us signed up with would be suicide in the midterms. If we speak up and demand to be heard, I had interest capitalized and high interest b/c mine are largely graduate is three times my mortgage and impossible to ever because of a struggle while getting started, and then during my primary earning years, I was hit with a serious health issue that made it impossible to do my job leading to a ballooning balance, many elderly are stuck with ballooned balances, even having their Social Security check partially garnished.Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't put anything past Republicans, but if we start advocating along with economists who understand that this is harmful to the overall economy our voices could be heard. Every single person with a student loan needs to be writing their representatives. I understand the feeling, but the best thing we can do is speak up, at least start sending letters to representatives and Joining in with some of the advocacy groups. This! Hundred percent this, we can't just complain about it here. Every single person should be writing their representatives and asking what they can do to help advocacy groups. Average people don't matter to Rs at all. The Ds also do a lot for the wealthiest, why but they at least do some things for average American, whereas Rs use their propaganda machine to vilify any program that is not geared towards the wealthy and corporations. I That would make sense, but it would benefit average people and that's not allowed, and the billionaires need their private loans so never gonna happen. That will have minimal impact without increases in state funding, the main reason for the ever rising tuition. They've been cutting it since Reagan. There is administrative bloat, but a lot of of that is needed to maintain regional accreditation and be eligible to offer financial aid. It's also just not gonna make that much of a difference at the vast majority of colleges. I know this is old, but I understand. I'll hit 25 years in 2026 when the tax bomb is set to come back. I feel like I can't catch a break and it's so depressing. My loan ballooned due to an accident I could never have foreseen. I'm so tired of the self-righteous ""youdidn't read your paperwork close enough, we paid our loans you pay yours"" hateful people. It's just so unfair. I hate Republicans so much! My hatred of Rs for doing this has created some dark revenge fantasies. Every single Republican could die tomorrow and I would celebrate. I'm technically independent, but the D issues I disagree with pale in comparison to how much I despise most Republican policy. They fear education because those with critical thinking ability and aren't billionaires won't vote for those psychopaths."
Ut_Prosim,2.545336401562545,0.0,2.545336401562545,Positive,"I don't see how a libertarian could argue against this in good faith.Wait -- of course, they could argue that this program should never have existed in the first place. They could also argue that it should be immediately phased out, and should not accept any new enrollees. But isn't ""contractarianism"" one of the pillars of the libertarian world view? I thought they were big on the idea that people should be bound by voluntary agreements made to reflect their personal interests (rather than being compelled by some external force)? Honoring voluntary contracts is the basis of all society. Once enrolled, the government and PSLF employees entered into such a contract. The employees promised to work in a specific field and region (as designated by the government) for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments under terms dictated by the government. If they did so, the government promised to discharge the remainder of their loans. The people in this story did just that, so they naturally expect the government to honor its side of the deal.Most of these folks made financial and life decisions based on this program. A lot of people took lower paying, crappier jobs, in areas where they didn't want to live, just to take advantage of this. They made a very detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing public service to industry, and this program is what tipped them towards the former. They sacrificed a lot, and took a large risk knowing that if the left a public service job before 10 years they'd lose 100% of their benefits, even if they worked for 99% of the term. The government also got a huge benefit, as it got to shift these professionals to regions and fields suffering shortages of workers.If these people had not enrolled, they could have refinanced with a private equity firm and gotten a lower APR. They could also have attacked their principal by making extra payments. In this program, the contract terms very explicitly required payments of 10-15% of income, no more, no less, all while the fixed interest (cannot be refinanced) accumulated. So if the government shafts them, they'll be far worse off than if the program had never existed in the first place.I don't see how you can call them freeloaders or entitled. If I promise a guy $50 to mow my yard and he does so, I can't then refuse to pay him and claim he's entitled for <surprised pikachu expecting a *handout* of $50. No, this is the case about SAVE. Biden introduced a friendlier repayment plan called SAVE that cuts monthly payments for a lot of people. The right challenged it for malicious reasons as expected, but the old plans under Obama and Trump weren't terrible. IIRC the original Bush era version required you to pay 15% of your income per month, and the Obama / Trump ones were down to 10%. The SAVE took undergrad loans down to 5%, and for grad loans allowed you to only count your own income instead of family income in the calculations (before, if you had a well paid spouse you were getting hosed as it took 10% of their income too). I think SAVE also had provisions where some [poor af] borrowers paid nothing. Public service loan forgiveness folks need to be in one of the income based repayment plans. If I understand correctly, this will force them to pick another (more expensive) plan, but it doesn't stop discharges when they reach their 10 years."
random-bot-2,2.531232447905796,0.0,2.531232447905796,Positive,"I used to work in financial aid, and transitioned into some public policy work. I'll put my thoughts on this and avoid any doomsday predicting.SAVE is on the chopping block, probably will not make it, but IDR and PSLF will remain. Even if congress tries to make changes, I imagine it would just be for new applicants. Most of us in it would be grandfathered in, and can continue to the 120.The department of Ed will remain, it is possible funding gets cut which could impact things such as Pell. This will suck, but schools will adjust. They will most likely do layoffs to get tuition back down to a level students can handle if grants are decreased. Not great, but not the end of the world.The loan programs will also stay. Even if there is a change, it will happen over time. At worst it would be phased out like Perkins loans.My honest speculation is very little will change for most of the department of Ed/student loans besides the save plan. Most of the doom and gloom you read on this subreddit will not happen, as typically happens when people spew doomsday rhetoric. I believe sometime in 2025 you will get to respond to this comment saying you're final done. Cheers, friend I was actually in a financial aid conference around 2020 that had sections about this issues. This does not absolve DeVos of anything, but here was some insight I got from that. Most of those applications were being denied from the lenders on technicalities, which in the letter of the law was correct. You need to be in specific plans in order to qualify for the PSLF, many of the applicants were not. This led to congress simplifying, and offering expanded qualification. This was in 2018, while trump was president. Much of the program has been simplified now, and they have, and still are, phasing out problematic loan lenders who were responsible. This was less a trump move, and more of a few bad apples on top of some confusing rules.I can see blaming him as a simple way to view this, but from my perspective the situation was much more complex than that. It has since had positive changes to prevent it in the future. Both presidents have had a hand in improving this I can understand your stress. I have a little one on the way, and need every dollar possible. 7 years in, working in public sector is not great for the bank account, but is worth it once I get the 120. Just keep in mind he did not change the plans when he was previously president, and the department of Ed/loans seem low on his list of things to do. I believe in 26/27 you'll be celebrating your kid turning 3 and being student loan free. I do agree with that aspect. What I believe is likely to happen is congress will make the program a little more restricted on who can get access, and officially add it. I don't think it just completely goes away because so many people have already gotten on to it. It runs the risk of economic impact and republicans are promising a strong economy for all. So I can't imagine they'll do something that could directly hurt that especially so soon into their terms, but politicians are idiots sometimes lol As someone who suffers from panic attacks, I am so glad to hear this. They are the worst. Hopefully the starts a more peaceful day/week for you Right, talking about changes to these things has seemed more of a talking point rather than political action for several years now. Just a cheap way to get some undecided people to side with you.I have hope for the SAVE, I actually thinks it's incredibly beneficial, and I think taking it away after running it for almost a year is going to create a lot of legal issues. But I can also see it going. Fingers crossed for all of us it stays I believe everything is safe but the SAVE plan. If I were to even bet on that, I bet it stays, but I still wouldn't be surprised if it goes. The way the idr plans were brought about would require a lot more than just a change of president to be taken away. You should look into how the IDR plans were introduced. Something brought through congressional legislation isn't so easily removed That's still apart of the IDR plans, and I truly don't believe there will be any changes to those programs. It is important to know that if you do get the forgiveness that way, it is considered taxable income. Obviously a long ways away, but you should consider keeping money aside for a potential tax bill.Take this with a grain of salt. I realized after a few comments I wasn't well-versed on the 20 year program, so I've started to read into it today Absolutely! Loans and elections are stressful enough. Glad I can provide a little relief to one aspect.On an unrelated note, I hope you enjoy having Witherspoon. I'm a Illini fan, and he was one of my all time favorite players to ever watch in Champaign. Such a ball hawk.Cheers, friend!"
urLocalpoopstain,2.517013039769486,0.0,2.517013039769486,Positive,"As the title said. I'm not paying a cent on my student loans. I don't work in my fieldEven if I did I wouldn't be able to find a job good enough to pay them back on top of my other expensesI regret getting my degree. I'm in love with it. I love the field. It's graphic and web and an MFA for my graduates program. Aced everything got a 3.8-4.0 GPA. This program made me genuinely happy. I freelance a lot and make a lot of money from that but it's enough for my expenses. I've applied to 9-5's all over but they literally pay minimum -ish wage and require bachelor's degrees. Like.....wtfHow does that make any sense? I'm guessing the worse that can happen is the payments defaulting but...there's nothing I can do I just don't have the money. It's either pay back worthless loans or eat and have shelter.Edit: Thank you for the suggestions and resources. I'm eligible for forgiveness since my school closed down and failed to give me resources after I graduated. I'm gonna go for an income based repayment plan. For those of you telling me I need to ""act like an adult"" without giving me any tips or resources you're not helpful and I see you only like typing for the sake of it. As you can see I'm frustrated about my situation which is an issue that millions of people have so I want you to look at these millions of people with the same energy and tell them all to ""just be an adult"" and pay back unrealistic prices for education when we weren't even set for success to pay them back. How were we supposed to know that the job and housing market would change THIS drastically? How were we gonna know that we weren't going to afford Bread or eggs and rent even with a full time job? All I wanted was to be happy and now I'm paying an almost impossible debt just for having dreams.Doesn't that sound unreasonably horrible to you? No one is co signed for me. And instead of not paying I'm gonna go for the income based repayment plan. They are. So I'll try for this. I think it stated that o had that option I thought america could still tax you even if you move away (idk if that's true, correct me if it isnt) This is probably a way better option than me being a salty bitch What L take. I see the value of a house before purchasing it. And I can sell the house if I don't want it. Eventhough I may or may not get that same value back from selling it, it's a tangible asset that will always be in profit since people need homes. You pay for an inspector you have garuntees that the home would be worth its price and if it isn't I can physically look at a home and TELL if it will benifet me or not. At this moment I was taken advantage of fresh out of high school with false ambitions. It's as if a badly influenced decision I made when I was a M I N O R shouldn't fuck me THIS HARD. Not at all especially since most Jon's REQUIRE a bachelor's and payed minimum wage. ""A lot"" in terms of being able to pay for my expenses. Which is A LOT for freelancing alone. Usually people can't even make equivalent to minimum wage freelancing. I can cover my current expenses and be able to afford food and shelter in the current market so yes ..it's a lot. And I've already been doing that. I do it all the time. You're right. I need to do more research on it and base prices over everything including cost of living. Good for you though man, contracting is tough work. I'm going through a carpentry class now and I'm only in the neginning of the HVAC course and it's already a doozy but I'm enjoying it. Old, I'll go with this. I'll just call before they start the payments in April. I'm eligible for the income based repayment plan and I may be able to apply for forgiveness based on the comments so ill do that. Ok* not ""Old"". Thanks autocorrect you made me sound like an asshole. My school is listed on here holy shit OMG, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I just read through the information on the site, and now I can call my loan representative to walk me through the process! I'm eligible since my school closed right after graduation. So I wasn't given any career resources that I was promised. They also charged us for housing that we didn't have. I was talking to my bestie about it, and she's gonna do the same. I have social security? These are facts. I guess unless I ""freelance"" for a firm or something (i think). But that's not the case for me. The degree type doesn't matter. I still learned a lot in the field that I still love. Idk why you're using this post to bash my field of choice. If I chose anything else I'd fail because I wouldn't be happy. So clearly this is an issue for a lot of people on this sub, if you don't have any facts or value to add to the conversation then why reply and comment? Why add negativity to an already frustrating topic? What's this gotta do with bidens plan? What are you even talking about man? If you hate students just say that"
snoopyvibes,2.487994620933069,0.0,2.487994620933069,Positive,"I have about $19k in student loans (if you include interest, principal balance is under $18.8k). I want to start making additional payments on them to get rid of them quicker. I hate having them linger and can financially afford additional payments. I do have 2 savings accounts - one for vacations/fun things and the other has enough to cover an emergency fund + savings for eventually a down payment on a house. Even with the additional payments, I am able to put money into savings still monthly. Whenever I mention wanting to pay student loans off quicker, everyone lectures me about it being a poor financial decision. They keep saying the US government will forgive loan balances and I'm basically throwing money away. My main intent on paying them off is it's my only debt left and I want to lower my debt to income ratio for a future mortgage. My question is - am I stupid for paying them off? I've lowered my balance already by $2k this year. It's an alarming number of people in my life who keep saying to stop making extra payments so I want to hear other opinions. Thanks! Yeah, I think I'm falling into the second bucket where I hate owing money. I paid my car off 2 years early because I had extra money. It was honestly stressing me out! That makes me feel better. They probably won't be paid off for another 2-3 years, but I'm hoping to throw any additional funds towards the principal of the loans. Makes sense - I am putting like 13% of my paycheck into my 401k with a 5% company match. It's auto increasing in a month or so, so I'm not terribly concerned. I think honestly my friends/family are more concerned that I've cut back on the ""fun"" things I used to buy. I still splurge a little with an occasional LEGO set or booking a vacation, but I have been cracking down a little bit. I'm still enjoying every day, so I'm not concerned. I think it's an outside perspective where instead of me buying 10 books from Barnes & noble, I'm using the library, and they think my life is ""sad"" now. Unfortunately, based on income the SAVE plan wouldn't make much sense for me. I make a little over $70k. I talked it through with my loan provider and they recommended a different plan for me to go through. My lowest interest rate is 3.5% and the bulk of them are 4.2%. Yesss that's what I'm hoping! I want to buy probably in like 2 years so I really want to lower my debt. My parents also very kindly helped me out with some college expenses so I'd love to pay mine off and then help pay their parent loan they took out for me. It's around $8k but I still feel guilty about it! That's a good thought process! I'm paying right around the same. I want them gone honestly. Yeah, was bummed to see the $10k off the table! At the time with interest frozen, I only had $18k in loans. If I had $8k left after the forgiveness, I was just going to take money from savings and pay it off. Oh well, guess I'll keep making the large payments and seeing what happens! I have 2 loans of 4.04%, 2 loans that are 4.2%, and 2 that are 3.51%. I've spending my energy on the ones with 4.2% interest I have 2 loans of 4.04%, 2 loans that are 4.2%, and 2 that are 3.51%. I've spending my energy on the ones with 4.2% interest Thanks for the recommendation! I've been trying to do something similar - I started a high yield savings account specifically for paying off loans. I have enough to pay down like $3k off my balance right now, but I have such anxiety about doing it and something popping up and me needing the $3k. Definitely growing up in a recession & seeing my parents penny pinch has been playing a part in this!"
waterwicca,2.4421242579257827,0.0,2.4421242579257827,Positive,"Sounds like you are on the SAVE plan, which is currently being challenged in the courts. Everyone on SAVE has been put in forbearance while the courts battle it out. Your idr was set to end (you would need to recertify in December to keep it) but they have pushed back all the recertifications by a year because of the court drama so you don't have to recertify until December 2025 now. But keep an eye on this sub for court updates in the next few months. They are likely to get rid of the SAVE plan and you may need to take action when they do. There are a few IDR plans right now (although they are not processing applications because of the court limbo as of now). Mostly people are assuming that the only safe one in the end will be ""IBR"" because of how it was legally made. It's all just speculation, though. People are not optimistic with Trump's administrations plans coming up fast. But really we just have to wait and see what the courts say first. It's just a waiting game right now. If you feel like doing some reading to get an idea about what's being going on with the court stuff:[This is a post that has been tracking the progress of the litigation.]( post is one of the most recent updates with a good forbes article on different idr options and their potential future.]( this post is addressing the changing dates on Idr recertifications.]( to add: [this is a page to learn about the different idr options as they exist right now]( If you're on the interest free ""stop save"" forbearance then they say that any payments will ""go towards satisfying future payments when payments resume"". So supposedly you can give your servicer money and they will just sort of hold onto it and apply it accordingly later on when the forbearance ends. No one really knows what that looks like. A lot of people have chosen instead to set aside the money they would normally use to make payments and put it somewhere like a high yield savings account so that money can work for you and earn some interest for you while you wait for the end of the forbearance. Then you can take that money out and work on paying your loans again when payments resume. As of right now no one will be accepted onto SAVE. They aren't processing applications at all right now. Supposedly they are accepting them and they are sitting there, but nothing will actually be done yet. They are supposed to start processing apps again in mid December. Not sure what that will exactly look like. People trying to move to anything but SAVE will probably get processed slowly but surely, but the SAVE apps might just sit in processing limbo while the courts figure it out. Make sure to keep a close eye on your email and loan accounts. This is just a guess, but unless the courts make a decision quickly, those in SAVE and applying to SAVE might sit on forbearance until there is a decision. Whether or not that's a good thing or not is up to you. When they do start processing applications, you should have the choice to choose a different IDR plan other than SAVE, but, just as a note of caution, some are worried other idr plans may run into legal challenges as well. Right now SAVE is the only one directly being challenged and probably thrown away, but make sure you stay on top of the news here in case anything else happens in the coming months."

It saddles them in debt for life and isn't necessary. Being from poverty, I am living proof higher education can be accomplished without debt if someone really tries. My family and I are alum from a lot of different schools:University of Oregon (Go Ducks!), Liberty, University of Utah (Go Utes!), University of the Southwest, University of Cumberlands, Arizona State University I'm from poverty and neither of my parents went to college. I knew if I wanted a shot at college (and needed my teeth desperately fixed) I had to join the military. At 18 I enlisted during wartime. Served honorably. Upon discharge I utilized my GI Bill and worked at Target from 12am-8am and attended class FT during the day. Yeah, I went without sleep sometimes but for me it was worth not having any debt. This is how I earned my undergrad. During graduate school I was a laboratory manager working 50 hours a week, married with two kids, took foster/adoption classes at night 2x a week to get state licensed as a foster parent so we could adopt, coached youth sports and never missed my daughter's soccer games and practices. Yeah...again...not much sleep but it sure beat going into debt or missing my family. I graduated with honors both under and grad school.My wife is from a well-off family and her parents paid her tuition but she was responsible for her insurance, gas, entertainment, books, fees. She had a partial scholarship as a cheerleader and paid her way by waitressing the same job for almost three years. She graduated at age 20 with honors - taking avg 18 credits and working.I wanted better for my kids so when they were born I invested $1000 into a 529 and also put $50 a month into them. My daughter did dual enrollment and graduated HS with her AA and stayed at home (no reason to live in dorms and pay $$). We used her fund for tuition. She will go on to a masters and she has enough in her fund to cover that too.My youngest wants to experience the dorm/college life and that's fine by me. We will help her financially and she has her college fund. She plans to just get an AA then go to trade school (court reporting). Living at home is the best scenario. I know that isn't healthy in some situations, but if a student can do it - it's best for the budget.Also, there are some amazing employers out there that offer tuition reimbursement for employees (even part time). Chipotle, Starbucks, and Amazon come to mind. I think I even saw Walmart. I was chatting with a young college student and employee of Chipotle a few weeks ago. She told me she loves her job, works part time, and gets about $5,500 in tuition support from the company. I believe (double-check) that Walmart employees get 100%. They are only for approved education programs - I believe anything from IT, healthcare, business, teaching - is included. Don't forget Pell Grant and to spend weeks (not a few hours) applying for any and all scholarships. Many of the smaller ones (say $500 a year) go unused because people aren't applying. I have a good friend who spent all summer just applying for scholarships of $500 or less and fully funded his degree. Good luck!"
PandaKing6887,2.3762707754067725,0.0,2.3762707754067725,Positive,"Under the current system, we are already paying back our original balance and then some for 20 years. The folks that got lucky to get forgiveness so far are forgiven because they already been paying for +20 years including both the principal and interest. The problem was always the predatory interest that make the loan get ridiculous with +20 years of payments. The propose bill just make the 10 years amount including both principal and interest the amount that everyone owe essentially waving all interest above that amount with the caveat that we have to pay back the 10 year amount. The student loan was never a grant program, the forgiven amount was always taxable until the pandemic so we always owe debt whether it's to the depart of education or the IRS. Would you rather it be medical debt or credit card debt instead - Murica. People need to read the propose bill before jumping to conclusion. The propose that people will only pay back what they would have under the 10 year plan means that what's crippling folks with owing 2-4x more on what they've paid after 10-20 years is fix. The predatory interest accumulation is the big problem. Folks with low income would have never paid off their loans after 20 years anyway because they would just be shifted to the IRS to be indebt to them instead so added another what 10-20 years of being in debt. Not only that, when the loan get ""forgiven"" they count as income so those people lose access to programs like food stamps, housing assistance, medicaid ect. Why do expert not talk about this other things when talking about low income people? Do people want these folks to lose access to food stamps or medicaid? It's a different perspective, people under the current system would rather pay the tax bill after 20 years with forgiveness haven't crunch the numbers so not sure which is better although folks who can't pay the tax bill will have to be in debt to the IRS instead. Well assuming what's left after the court is IBR vs this new bill. It's question of do someone want IBR with forgiveness being tax income after 20 years with all the interest accumulation or the new bill with obligation just for the standard 10 years principle and interest only with the rest interest waived with the caveat of no forgiveness. It's basically the standard 10 year plan but with interest waiver built in to cap the total obligated payment to just the 10 year principal and interest. The hard part for a lot of folks to swallow is no forgiveness ever so it sounds dystopian being in debt to the government forever although the current system is like that with being indebt to the IRS with forgiveness but it apparent sounds more humane to instead of being in debt to the department of education forever, we get to swap from the department of education to the IRS. Assume that your obligation to pay each month is $100. You pay that amount but that amount only cover the interest and not the principal, under the propose bill after you pay $100, $50 would get apply to the principal so you are making progress however small. If you decide to pay $150, 100 would cover the interest and 50 would go toward principal and that's the end of that for that month. The cap on what you have to pay on the 10 year plan is retroactive, so if you can prove that you already did your obligations, than in theory you are done. The propose IDR is called the ""Repayment Assistance Plan"". No, the student loan component of the ED department would be transfer to the treasury department which conveniently also handle collection of taxes, which most people would be transfer to them after 20 years of forgiveness anyway since student loans forgiveness are tax. One way or another outside of public service loans, forgiveness is just being transfer to another government agency so that they can collect the debt."
EmergencyThing5,2.325010365354704,0.0,2.325010365354704,Positive,"The HEROES Act was around for almost 20 years by the time Biden tried to use it for student loan forgiveness. Before 2022, no one believed it allowed the President to forgive loans. The Congress that passed the ACT at the time believed there was really no cost to the HEROES Act because it effectively just deferred things until the crisis passed. It is absolutely fine to want a student loan relief program, but it was always ridiculous to say that the HEROES Act somehow allowed for it. Even with that, the Federal Government loses billions on these loans every year. That's exactly why it won't pass. This legislation would cost more than $50 billion a year, and it doesn't include a single thing that would raise revenue to both offset some of that cost and make it somewhat palatable to Republicans who would need to be on board to even get it to a vote before 2027. It doesn't have a single co-sponser either. Therefore, it has effectively no chance of ever coming to a vote. It's not a real bill. It's just an excuse to issue a press release. We need real efforts that have some hope of coming to fruition. This bill is a joke. I guarantee Lawler is putting no effort into getting it actually passed. No offense, but it's literally one guy. There are no co-sponsers, and this bill goes away entirely in a few weeks. There is no coordinated effort by Republicans on this. Introducing this bill just let that one guy issue a press release, nothing more. MOHELA has never publicly commented on the lawsuits, so no one knows their actual position. They have not publicly helped Missouri with the lawsuits though and they haven't filed a lawsuit themselves. Since none of the other servicers sued to stop it, I would assume they also wouldn't have sued if not for Missouri suing on their behalf. The Federal Government is their largest customer, so it seems reasonable that they wouldn't have sued them if it were up to them. However, MOHELA will likely never comment on it as they are effectively controlled by the State of Missouri who is the one pushing forward with the lawsuits. Assuming the information in OP's post is accurate and complete, there's almost no way all of this debt could be federal and eligible for forgiveness under PSLF. There's no way to get federal debt in the student's name that equates to $250k at age 26 for just a bachelor's degree due to loan limits. The majority of this debt either is a parent plus loan or private debt. If that is the case, OP's significant other is going to have a tough time dealing with this even if they get some of it forgiven. Undergraduates are generally limited to $31K in direct loans in total for their bachelors degree. Some borrowers can be considered independent and the limit increases to $58K, but that is pretty rare. That's the aggregate limit, not per year. Seeing as how student loan interest accrual was paused for like half the time OP's significant other had their loans, I wouldn't be surprised if more than $200K of their balance wasn't eligible for PSLF. Some of their outstanding debt probably is though, but it's a probably a small fraction. If the borrower incurred this debt for a grad degree, the whole situation can be very different. However, if this debt is just for undergrad, this is likely going to be a massive financial burden."

[source]( That used to be the case but not anymore. One undergraduate semester at my Alma mater, as an in state resident at a public state school, is now $16,062 for just the tuition and fees. That doesn't include housing, food, and other expenses. Most college programs are four years for an undergrad, meaning 8 semesters. That's $128,496 for an undergraduate degree, not including living expenses. There are grants and scholarships but you can't count on getting those as the competition is often fierce since most people are struggling to pay for this too and applying for every bit of available aid that you are. So yeah, an undergraduate degree from a public school easily ends up being 100k in debt if you get some scholarships, or have help from family, or work as much as you can to cover some cost. It's even more if you don't have those things. The best part is that most jobs require a bachelors. Even jobs that have no business requiring degrees. So yeah, young people's choices are limited these days. I literally went to my Alma Maters website and did a cost of attendance estimate today. So no, it's not 2022 data. And even if it was, nothing has gotten cheaper since then so idk what your point is regardless The average cost of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $27,146 per year or $108,584 over 4 years.[source]( is actually below the national average cost of a degree. Scholarships aren't given out like candy and everyone is applying for them. Part time work (if you can find a decent job) isn't going to be able to cover 30k a year. And many specialized ""marketable job skills"" programs actively discourage you from working part time. Living frugally is a bonkers statement in the current economy for middle and lower income earners.TLDR, you can't financial literacy your way out of this kind of price gouging, and suggesting people can, should, whatever is ignorant and blind to the current challenges young people are facing. So to make sure I understand you, your point is that college costs aren't exorbitant. And then you are listing sixish different things people have to do as workarounds to try and get past the exorbitant price tag on college tuitions. Also living on campus from my example is ""renting a room"", generally it's a shared room in a dorm. So you aren't cutting costs from that option there. Many people don't live within commuting distance to live at home and go to school. And if they do, then they will need transportation, so that costs money too. If you can find a part time job for $15/hr (good luck but let's play it out) and can average 15 hours a week every week for the entire year and never have to take any significant time off for finals and stuff, then you made a whopping $11,700 for the year. Not to mention, like I said, intense programs often discourage you from working so you can ""focus on your studies"". Hopefully you don't mind starving half the time and utter exhaustion from working and going to school full time at the same time!Associate's degrees are great, particularly for trade jobs, but increasingly, jobs want a bachelors. Even for jobs that shouldn't need one. It's stupid. So if you don't want to go into a trade the associates isn't a viable option for you.Community college is an option and one I advocate for with younger generations in our current educational climate, but you aren't guaranteed acceptance into a university after. So you might just be screwing yourself if you pay out for a community college and later you can't get into a university for the degree you are pursuing. Instead of blaming the people being shit on for not bringing an umbrella, we need to focus on the exploitation happening to our young people in the form of education. More and more jobs are requiring degrees, any degree. So people entering the work force are just screwed if they want to be successful at most careers. And we need people to be able to enter into all careers, not just the ones that have a lower education requirement. The cost of tuition in PUBLIC universities is exploitative. They need to be available and accessible to the public. It's literally what they are for. We have to stop gatekeeping higher education behind money. And we have to stop calling people doing their best to educate themselves ""stupid"" or ""gullible"". It's a damn diversion tactic to keep costs high while the plebeians fight each other. And you are falling right for it. Yes, students should have to live in a trailer to get an education..... That's an entirely rational and well reasoned expectation for our kids so they can ""earn"" their degree with out of the box thinking. /s ""The average cost of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $27,146 per year or $108,584 over 4 years""Every school is expensive. That's the problem. [source]( I'm not sure how to explain averages to you. Or the fact that your lived experience doesn't mean it's the same for everyone else. I'm glad you got enough aid to make it tolerable. That's really great. You only have 10k, that's awesome! That's doable! What's not awesome is saying that because it worked this way for you, it should for everyone else and if it doesn't it's their fault for not making it happen that way. Not everyone qualifies for the same federal aid, not everyone can work throughout, not everyone lives near a ""low cost"" school. Not every ""low cost"" school has the programs for the career you choose. That average I told you was for public universities. Not Ivy League or private, any of those factors that people shame others for ""choosing"" to go the more expensive, prestigious route. These schools are available for their public and should be accessible to their public and they aren't. That is the problem. By saying it's only as expensive as you choose to make it is ignoring the problem. I'm disappointed in you, but I'm hopeful that you'll eventually understand that just because not everyone has the same experience as you doesn't mean they deserve to be shit on. We all deserve better. And when people stop blaming the ones getting shit on for not bringing an umbrella, we can start fixing systemic issues and maybe make things like education better for future generations. It might be too late for us, but we can still advocate for others."

You don't lose that history for another decade.Congrats! I was in the first round last summer, 55 years old here, similar to you. It was a real relief for me. This true of credit cards and other accounts as well btw. It's a common myth to ""never close your oldest credit card,"" but in reality it doesn't matter with respect to your age of accounts. You have 10 years to continue building credit before it falls off your history. On the other hand, accounts closed in *bad* standing, with derogatory remarks (like it was charged off, sold to a debt collector, defaulted, etc.) remain on your report for 7 years and will continue to drag your FICO score down for that long. This must depend on the credit reporting agency, no? No. Because when I consolidated my student loans VantageScore Vantage score isn't a credit reporting agency. It's an algorithm, that virtually no lender uses or cares about, that *calculates* a credit score based on information from the three major credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. I do not know of any major lender that uses a Vantage score to actually make a lending decision. Many of them, and many apps, like Credit Karma, provide a Vantage score because it's free. If you actually apply for credit, they will pull a FICO score. I have personally seen my FICO and Vantage scores differ by as much as 100 points, even using data from the same credit bureau. I've also seem them move in completely opposite directions with the same changes in usage and history. Apps and sites than use Vantage scoring spam me all the time. Nobody has ever e-mailed or messaged me saying ""your FICO score is looking *great*, good job! Maybe a new card is in your future!"" Or better, ""Codece, your FICO score might get better from a new card!"" FICO is a secret formula. It's a bunch of them. It's owned by the Fair Issac Corporation. They own it. They invented credit scoring. Your FICO score is what matters.FICO scoring models consider a closed account in good standing for 10 years in terms of calculating age. What I really don't understand is if your vantage score is useless and also does a poor job of approximating your FICO score then whats the point?Imo? It's used mostly by people trying to sell you something, tracking your usage of their product, how many times you view your score, and manipulating your fears about credit scores. It's used by 3rd party sites and apps who don't really care about your actual credit worthiness. Just like sub-prime mortgage lenders in the late 2000s didn't care. They're just getting a referral bonus, after that it doesn't matter to them."

There are plenty of public schools that can use tax dollars better. My tax dollars shouldn't go to a bloated for profit system.2nd step: No government money goes to public schools for non educational purposes. Want to pay millions for new stadiums and coaches? Your sports programs need to be separately funding themselves. The same goes for extra student amenities. Funded independently of taxpayers dollars, students can opt into paying for access to ""special student lounges."" I would include dorms and basic meal plans in funding.3rd step: Increase funding to community and vocational colleges. 2 year degree is publicly funded. This covers a lot and for a whole lot cheaper. Get an associate degree free and then only pay extra for the bachelor degree. 2 years of college are publicly funded with no debt based on merit. These 3 steps would go a long way in building our country to be better and more globally competitive. They would also eliminate a lot of incentives driving up education costs. We keep going, though.4th step: Change new student loan payment structure. No loan payment, instead a taxed payback plan of 20 years based on income. After 20 years, there are no more education taxes. You make billions from your education, and you pay more. You make less as HVAC tech, and you pay less. Society pays for your education, and you pay society (future pupils) back (forward). There is a lot of nuance to work in this step.5th step: Loan forgiveness on existing debt. We two step this and have forgiveness start for old people. Anyone on social security or disability has debt forgiven. We continue to reduce the age requirement until we hit a point where only all legacy loans are eliminated, and only the new income based tax payments apply.6th step: Switching existing loans to an income based tax. This also happens over time at a rate more accelerated than the forgiveness program. This would decrease the existing burden on those not eligible for forgiveness yet. If an existing loan is better for high income individuals, they can keep the current loan.The end goal and outcome would be that anyone can get a two year degree publicly funded based on merit. Those who go to school longer don't have a debt per say. The higher incomes from more education would have extra taxes to pay back or pay it forward.P.S. For people who already paid off their debt. The above plan probably wouldn't have you missing out much. You put yourself in a great spot thru dedication and hard work. Enjoy buying a boat or vacation house later in life instead of paying for your children's education.

High income, low debt people never benefitted off IDR plans in the first place.Mid income, mid debt people are the only group that get a benefit sometimes, but its marginal. Some quick calculations: legislation seems to be more deterrence to borrowing so people don't engage in the moral hazard of over borrowing. However, if you ask most people, they don't take out 300k+ in loans with a plan to make $30k per year. Sometimes life just happens and doesn't go as planned.For example, someone with 10k in debt and an income of $30k would be paying for 18 years. Someone making 100k with 140k of debt would be paying for 25.2 years. Also, if you have kids, it's not more forgiving, unlike existing* IDR plans. Your payment is lower, but you just have to make it up with more overall payments. Similarly, 401k and HSA contributions don't confer a benefit since your reduced payments need to be made up later in life. I added existing* to clarify The salary is adjustable. Feel free to edit the spreadsheet after making a copy. I understand that it's more forgiving than having only the standard plan, buts it's actually less forgiving than existing IDR plans I literally have been giving student loan advice on the internet for about a year and a half. I couldn't even communicate this information to my 18 year old brother in a manner sufficient to get him to change his mind. Social pressure to go to college and certain colleges can outweigh being rational, especially in teenagers. You can argue that they were of legal age and signed a contract. However, most underwriters for other loans would never enter into that contract with them. The real solution is finding a way to bring the costs of education down. Well, there are infinitely possible forms of the same plan that would be equally fair, yet they chose this one. They could've done 5% of your discretionary income or 15% of one's discretionary income. They could've used a 5-year amortization period as the standard for these purposes. Why did they choose this variation of ""fair"" It's uncommon to not grandfather something in. Everything can be legally changed, including the constitution so it's a matter of probability rather than possibility. It's unlikely they take you off current plans but not impossible Your wages are garnished, which is at a higher income percent than IDR plans with no discretionary income reduction Education and training is different. Most jobs don't really require heavy education. I would say that K-12 education is sufficient for 80+% of people. This is generally funded through property taxes. I have a law degree and practice law. Little would have changed in my practice if I went straight to my job after the first year of law school. Jobs use education and grades as a way to find the ""good employees."" Grades and scores are one of the few ""hard signals"" that employers can rely upon, so they do just that. Training on the other hand is generally footed by employers. Most difficult jobs, your employment is at a loss the first few months since it's inefficient and likely prone to errors. Additionally, the person training you has to do their job plus train you. Because dems made it an issue, and republicans responded by opposing the dem's attempt to address that issue Also implemented SAVE Because SAVE had a 225% poverty guideline multiplier and a 100% interest subsidy, compared to 150% multiplier and a 50% subsidy under REPAYE. SAVE is much more generous than other plans for low income borrowers.SAVE was enacted similarly to PAYE and REPAYE so when the litigation of SAVE was enacted, PAYE and REPAYE came under threat since they were passed under the same process. Agreed. Otherwise, we either have (i) runaway student loan debt or (ii) lack of access. This shifts treasury payments from the wealthy to the working class (regressive) so it does confer some benefit to the hyper wealthy from a tax perspective For federal taxation, there's an insolvency exception, as described in my post that I also recently responded to your comment. Additionally, student loan forgiveness is exempt at the federal level from taxation until the end of 2025. After which, congress can decide to extend the exemption or let it lapse.Loan debt forgiveness, in general, has been taxable for a very long time so these laws aren't new by any means. 255k. No, it is a minor concern. I just pay my income based repayment and focus on investing and paying off my mortgage.It's literally my last priority since it can be reduced if my income decreases and the government can't foreclose on my degree.If you haven't maxed out your 401k for the year, it typically does not make sense to pay extra for federal student loans Debt to income ratio is based on monthly student loan payments not the total debt amount. If your monthly payment is $0, they use like 0.5% of your total balance as your monthly payment. So for $250k of loans, the lender calculated that my monthly payment is $1250 for their calculation of DTI.

Didn't people start repaying their loans in between the two? I paid on my loans that were under Navient all through Covid and all of them were accruing interest. OK now I understand what you meant by the five years. I was on IBR and had to pay my large loans during the ""pause "". I did not have to pay on my small loans that were owned by AIDVANTAGE. I have not had to pay during the SAVE pause, but my no interest is about to end because I will be on the borrower defense forbearance as soon as that paperwork goes through. Whatever it is what it is. Not for borrower defense. I just sent in my borrower defense application yesterday and my school is up there on the list of scam schools. I have a really strong case. Other than that, zero faith in any type of blanket loan forgiveness. I don't even know why they tried in the first place. It just made things worse for everyone. Now SAVE is likely going to be gone because they had to make it so extra with the added loan forgiveness. SAVE would have flown under the radar if that was not added onto it. I do believe we will get forgiveness, as our master promissory note states, after 20-25 years on an income driven repayment plan. You can Google it or join the borrower defense sub Reddit. What school? mine was Argosy university. They got shut down for defrauding the government out of student loan funds and had a retention rate of 17% after they took all of our student loan money with no degree. I earned 96 credit hours and did not get a degree from that program. I'm glad they're finally doing something about it 20 years later. If your school is on the list, do not sleep on this. Your application needs to get in before the next presidency I know I'm stuck with 243K. Check in see if the school is on there. You can likely find the list on the borrower defense sub, but if you had ""life factors"" that kept you from getting a degree, they're not going to forgive that. It needs to be in relation to something that the school did such as fraud or misrepresenting the program to get you to enroll. You might have a shot if they took away your degree program and did not allow your credits to transfer into a different program, even if your school is not on the list. Was that the case? Yeah you can't get loans forgiven unless there was fraud. How many years have you been paying under an income driven repayment plan? Dude I feel your frustration! I know it sucks for me because I had to consolidate in order to get on SAVE (make all my loans direct) so all of my interest got compounded for no reason because SAVE is likely going bye-bye. Meanwhile I've been enrolled in an income driven repayment plan this whole time because I was also told those are the only years that count towards repayment. I am worried that they're not going to count the time before consolidation, as they never did before this one time adjustment (your term ""look back"" is called ""the one time adjustment"" for future reference ) nonsense that has not happened yet. What a mess. At least you're on an income driven repayment plan and hopefully your payments won't be too much and eventually the one time adjustment will go through and everything will be fine. I'm trying to just enjoy not having to pay on them right now and take every bit of money I have and put it towards a down payment on a house. Hopefully the forbearance will not mess up my financing. Thank you for sharing your rational point of view. I agree with everything you said. None of our income driven repayment plans were taken away from 2016 to 2020. This doom and gloom will not get anyone anywhere. SAVE will hopefully stick around and the one time adjustment that was promised to us will hopefully still happen. If the cost of living was included in tuition, tuition would include the cost of living so therefore tuition would be way more expensive. Nothing is free. Who would pay for the tuition and cost of living? When I was in college, it cost the same for me to live in the dorms as it did to live off campus with a roommate. The food plan was more expensive in the dorms than it was if I went grocery shopping. I wouldn't do it until you need to. The paperwork is likely to get rejected anyways. always call your loan servicer to doublecheck, don't rely on Reddit."

Now it looks like when they implement it using the second method I won't be eligible for forgiveness. I'm really frustrated by it because my wife and I were looking at starting a family and this basically sets me back 2.5 years of grinding out payments. It was so frustrating because I was literally down to a principal balance of $500. I foolishly didn't park l that money into a High Yield Saving account to wait out the litigation. I don't have an exact number in front of me. I want to say it was around the 60k. I've been paying for years. If you exclude the pandemic and the pause I would have paid them off early. What frustrates me is there are thousands of REPUBLICANS in Congress who had their PPP loans whole sale forgiven. So they are all in favor of loan forgiveness, just not for a group other than themselves. I feel the same way. It's so funny to me they republican party complains that it can't get young people to vote for them. Maybe don't screw over millions of young working-class people. I actually gave props to Trump to pausing student loan payments and forgiving loans for veterans. If the rationale was good enough for Trump, why did Republicans suddenly have a change of heart when Biden used the same exact rationale? Sure it was political, that's the whole point of policy to do things your voters want. But if you take steps to strip a benefit away from a group of people whether it's Republicans or Democrats, dont come to me with crocodile tears when said group says they aren't going vote for Republicans again. I'm sure there a lot of folks on this subreddit who feel the same way I do.Bottom line, I would be debt free right now, starting a family without student loan debt, for others it might be purchasing a car, buying a house, maybe even starting their own business, but because of the REPUBLICANS I'm not, because I'm back in debt. Why do I blame Republicans? It's because if they had not brought the lawsuits I would literally be debt free right now. The individuals who encourage millennials to take out debt to get education were our parents and teachers who were both Republicans and Democrats. Bottom line is there's a direct line between a benefit my family would have received and that benefit being taken away and the political party that orchestrated it was the Republicans. They will never get my vote they rest of my life. Look I did pay them off, all the hard work you talked about, I did that. Used my bonuses, paid extra on them etc. I was literally down the last $500 of principal and I was eligable for the loan forgiveness. So I requested a refund on the funds I had paid during the pandemic (I continued paying never stopped). My mistake was not sticking the funds in a high yield checking account (my one and only mistake in this process). Then the forgiveness got struck down. Don't come at me with Bullshit about how I didn't pay, I did and I got screwed over by a political party hell bent on keeping young people down. Here here They took direct action that led to a negative impact for millions of Americans. This stuff isn't rocket science. If you hurt the pocketbooks/financial situation of a group of people don't expect them to vote for your party. Same thing happened with Abortion. You struck down Roe, which was a right women enjoyed for decades and now they find that right taken away from them (depending on where you live). Don't be shocked and surprised when they are motivated and vote against you. No I know that the Dems are not perfect angels. They are appalling in a number of ways I could easily list off for you. The bottom line is right now the republican action is having a direct negative impact to my families well-being/financial situation so they aren't getting my vote. Sorry from my perspective it's the Republicans fault full stop. There is literally nothing you can tell me to change my mind.

I was paying on them regularly, then during the pandemic my payments were paused, due to the SAVE program I think? It looks like they are due to resume payments in July, but the first year is 0 payments, so confusing! I've worked for a non profit hospital for over 10 years. I applied for the PSLF, but they said I haven't made enough qualifying payments. I also consolidated, but still haven't heard anything. I make less than the income threshold.

That's crazy that they defrauded you like that! Glad it got resolved! Imagine how many other people are in similar situation and don't know it. My state college charged me 36K for a 2 year online Bachelors degree. I never set foot on campus, except to walk across the stage! I would consider that fraud, or at least shady! It was a joke. Sarcasm lol... It was sarcasm lol. A joke about how crazy expensive it was.. I actually qualify for disability but I choose to continue working. I had spinal surgery after a serious accident, and my spinal cord was damaged during the surgery. I have partial paralysis in my toes, calves and pelvis, saddle paralysis causing a neurogenic bladder and bowel, and have a permanent urinary catheter. But I love my job and wanted to continue working, so I have PT/OT weekly, and was fitted with braces to help me walk better. It's a challenge but worth it to remain independent and keep working in a career I love. Based on my disability - and the recommendations of my neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon, and my PCP. And I don't just have a little PT, OT and some assistive aids. Trust me it's way more than that. I have to take breaks during the day to do bowel care because my bowel is paralyzed. I have to do catheter care and take all kinds of medicine just to get through the day. I am not looking for any type of sympathy, I'm just saying I couldn't stay home and not work, mentally that would be the thing that does me in. I enjoy being around people, caring for critically ill children, feeling like I can make a difference. Someday I will not be able to work, but until that day I will continue to fight the good fight. Yet the news leads everyone to believe that the loans are getting dropped off left and right. I understand that now, but all of the information I was reading was that people that haven't been paying on them long, or been working toward their pslf were getting them forgiven. I was even led to believe from some people I work with that they had theirs forgiven already, individuals that graduated the same time I did. I am by all definitions disabled, but I choose to make accommodations to continue working full-time. Maybe I should throw in the towel and just file for the disability, but I just can't, I love what I do. I guess paying back student loans is my penance for fighting the good fight lol.. I do, my hospital is listed."

While this was a relief, it has created an unexpected challenge for me now.Because my federal student loans were forgiven, I am no longer eligible for federal student loans for graduate school. This means I would need to take out private loans, which often come with higher interest rates and less favorable terms.Additionally, I had hoped to qualify for the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, but my counselor informed me that I might not be eligible because I have several IT certifications and it might not be difficult for me to find a job. This program is designed for veterans who have significant barriers to employment.If anyone has found a workaround for this situation or has advice on how to qualify for the VR&E program despite having certifications, please share your insights. I really want to pursue graduate school, as most of my team members have master's degrees, and I feel it will be a disadvantage for me if I don't have one.Stay informed and make the best decision for your situation.NOTE: Currently work for the government GS11/12 Edit: After all the comments and suggestions, I called Nelnet and was informed that it is reversible. They will be sending me a one-page form to fill out and send back with a benefits letter. Thank you for taking the time to comment. Make sure to use all your benefits because you earned them! I left the private sector for the government. I don't wanna go back. Someone suggested UMGC 25% for federal employees. I'll try to get that No, I haven't been placed on PIP, I think I am doing very well in my team. I think it may be insecurity. All the GS9s coming to dept at least have a master's and almost everyone in my team. I am hoping that wouldn't put me at a disadvantage if I applied for GS13 come next year.Thank you, I will definitely look at the UMGC 25% of program. That's where I got my BSC from Thank you! This made me feel betterI came from the private sector and wouldn't wanna go back. I am way more experience than most of the Higher GS on my team, and I thought a master degree would be helpful to get there. That's what I am thinking. I wished I knew about the loan forgiveness fully understood I would have if I was still in the private sector. Took a pay cut to the fed, just to realize almost everyone i know got one. It's pretty doable with a lot of sacrifice. This was just a warning for others There are, but only if you go to State University. I will look into that, too. Thank you Yap. Waiting to get done with probation and start working on it I will be calling them before the end of the week I called them yesterday, and yes, it is reversalable. I'll definitely be doing that. Thank you! Call them. I was told it is possible, and I've applied for reversal. There's about a 120-day waiting period, and I am still waiting I think there's been a misunderstanding. My point isn't about complaining about student loan forgiveness. It's about understanding the long-term implications before taking advantage of such programs.For context, I didn't apply for the VR&E program; they reached out to me. After I responded, they informed me that I wouldn't qualify due to my certifications. If I had understood what VR&E does, I wouldn't have pursued it, even though they contacted me.It's crucial to be aware of how loan forgiveness and other programs might affect future educational opportunities, especially for those considering graduate school. They've student loan forgiveness or maybe TA. I'm on probation, and I'll pursue that once I am done Yes. You're correct, and that was the counselor argument 2 years ago I worked in IT and have the required certs to get jobs in that field with no plans to do anything. I understand why the counselor said I wouldn't qualify Why was that and how did you do it? Wow. Was it for a masters too. I am looking into 25% off for federal employees discount by UMGC and would certainly hope that happened. Thank you I have a lot of experience coming in. I just wanted to make sure getting to GS13 next year wouldn't be difficult. I am surprised with the number of people coming in at GS09 with masters degree Me too,but most of them have no experience. My manager had asked me to mentor some of them, and their concerns are not having enough real work experience. Maybe at some point they will have the experience. The fed need to do a better exposure for them Thank you for this comment! I am very doing great at my job per my manager. I was not hopeful that GS13 would be possible for me without a graduate. That is definitely insecurity on me I will take a chill pill and take it easy and be more grateful. HUAH!! I had to fill out the form because I thought I was done with school due to exhaustion from work and school. That was a big mistake.I don't think I will be able to reverse that decision Yes. It does. I don't know the whole process. I heard 10k student loan forgiveness, and I'm not sure whether that's yearly. I will look it up. Thank you! I'll probably call them for clarification on that. I will certainly have to take some type a loan for my masters"
indy1386,2.021242101901911,0.0,2.021242101901911,Positive,"This \^\^\^You combine all that with people that don't have the gift from a parent like OP. That come from literally nothing and have a dream of making something for themselves. work hard through school and then the market crashes and nobody is paying or hiring. and the ones paying are paying very little with next to nothing raises each year that force them to jump around to make a decent living. Which is a cost in itself, the stress of a new job, location most of the time leads to many other insecurities. In order to jump around to make a better salary most people that do that are single. Imagine uprooting a family every year or two. so those people are typically single and already paying a higher cost to live on there own so paying those loans back become even more difficult. Its just one of those that your damned if you do damned if you dont. Basically you stay single you can bounce around and make a higher salary easier. But you pay for it by having to fend for yourself.If you get married and have someone you trust then you can benifit by splitting bills and progressing, but this typically comes with kids wich are not cheap these days. Typically both parents need to work wich leaves daycare and daycare costs are insane. Yes, you could have a parent stay home and take care of the kid but now you have one salary taking care of a family, and in todays world not as easy as it was for our parents and even they had a tougher time then our grands wich was the norm. Its one of those things that makes you think its designed to keep people down but the reality is that people suck and will always find a way to exploit a situation. This. if you fail to use the degree you are out of luck. I graduated in 08 and I was lucky to find work. But I know a bunch of people that came out with that loan and no job. 30k is less then the average public in state total tuition currently.... But you are an awesome parent. I could not imagine a huge chunk like that being taken away from mine. That 100-200 a month is a big bill for most families. Good job getting ahead of things and helping out! Seems like your son is a hard worker and deserves every bit. average in state public tutition not staying on campus is 27,940 a year. So yes it would cover a year. And to be honest that 30k knocked off of what would be about 120k at the end (if OP's son goes to in state college and doesn't stay on campus) adds up a ton. Imagine paying down 90 vs 120. I wanted a good education. I went to a top school for my profession at the time. Unfortunately the market crashed when I graduated in 2008 so fortunately I had that good Education and I was able to get a job in a time where nobody was hiring. The sad part is the pay was hot garbage. although it was nothing to sneeze at it was far less then I had planned for knowing I was taking out 110k for school. Half went towards tuition (this covered books, software, anything I needed to graduate. The school provided with cost of tuition, I didnt go buy the top of the line PC or anything) Half went towards living expenses for the 2 years I was in school. I was in class physically 40 hrs a week and typically had external class work so I was busy with my education easily 50-70 hrs a week. I did not have time to have a job and nobody did that went to school with me. I decided to get my BA in comp sci at an accelerated rate because I didn't want to party and I knew the real experience was out in the world. unfortunately it took 10 years before I was making what I expected to make when I got out of school. Now I could certainly have jumped around company to company and made more money, but my morals got the best of me and I always wanted to see projects through. Money was less important to me then the work I was doing. So, I was on income based repayment all of that time. I have payed over 80k back to which 55k is interest. The majority of that has been in the passed 2 years as that Im finally able to afford doing so. All this to say its not just high balances, or misunderstanding of loans. I would argue that these loans are predatory. Most people are stuck paying them there lives and only because they were not born into money or financially responsible parent or ones that cared. Say I had those living expenses paid for. I doubt Id be in any school debt at this point. Id be paid off long ago. The creditors should not be giving out such loans, school cost should be better subsidized. to simply say its high balances and people not understanding debt is an oversimplification of the matter at hand. Should people not have the opportunity for a good education? Also my generation was told you had to go to college if you wanted to have a good life. and if you did so you would. Sadly, a lot of people go to college blind and not know what they want to do and lack the drive. then they get out with a worthless education and a bill and end up working the same job they could have without that job. I do love that more information is getting presented to persuade the upcoming generation to go to trade schools. College isn't for everyone.[ not 30k wont cover the cost of the average in state public 4 year tuition. but it sure makes a good dent which is nice!!. I wish I had such a gift to start off with.TLDR: You're not wrong high balances are a problem. lack of education of loans and percentage rates are also a huge problem. But there are far more to the equation then people overspending and education should be a right not a privilege."
OrangeTabbiesDad,1.942330035026609,0.0,1.942330035026609,Positive,"The courts so far have only touched in passing on the old ""horse left the barn"" issue. The district courts rulings were just as to preliminary injunctions on ""likely to succeed"" grounds, and the 8th so far has only issued language supporting the emergency motion pending appeal. Nothing has been concluded yet that has precedential value. If the 8th does now issue an actual ruling in the near future, that may change, though the matter is still only the scope of preliminary injunction. Also findings of law are limited to their own circuit, even if the injunction itself extends nationally. But whether the forgiveness horse truly left the barn remains to be seen, and possibly litigated, depending on just how draconian the new Department chooses to be, so I would take this particular guy's opinion with a grain of salt. Changes to the US Code by Congress, or to the CFR by the Department, or to either by a high court, will become the prevailing law for borrowers. That happened to my own loans, and the notes I signed became subject thereto, when the Department years later published rules extending IBR to FFEL. These things can go in the other direction too. How they craft laws and rules regarding the application of retroactivity, possible grandfathering, and claw-back if they really want to try that (maybe as an accounting correction, much as the IDR Adjustment was), is all up in the air now. I think the latter is a long shot, but not impossible. The cruelty is the point. Assuming the law will still mean anything next year, other than as window dressing, what the 8th does will not be the law of the land but only that of the 8th Circuit. Though granted any universal injunction has nationwide effect.As a reset, the appeals in the 8th and 10th Circuits just cover the scope of preliminary injunctions. The plaintiffs want the entire Final Rule enjoined, much as the 8th ordered for a couple weeks some months back (thus causing a glitch in the matrix). To my knowledge there were no motions for summary adjudication below other than partly as to dismissal, and thus no final judgment or permanent injunction regarding the Final Rule yet exists. But, the plaintiffs would also like the circuit opinions to contain interpretations of the law, even if just in dicta, endorsing their theory that Congress never intended forgiveness at the end of 1993-ICR-based repayment plans. I think that's crazy town, or at minimum protected by limitations periods, but here we are.Luckily we are not now before SCOTUS, where a holding regarding ICR-based forgiveness could indeed become the law of the land. Instead, it's possible we will see the parties move to put everything on long hold, possibly by stipulation, with the effect similar to what Jack Smith is now doing. Next year, these actions may ultimately be mooted by an incoming Department's published notice to withdraw the Final Rule and/or new proposed rules that amend the CFR more to their own ideology. How they go about ending these cases may matter in regards to timing and grandfathering. I surmise this is all being strategized right now by the transition team and packs of Heritage Foundation lawyers.However that settles out, instead of Missouri and CATO, the lawsuits then start flying from blue states, borrowers, and consumer organizations. The game begins anew, and eventually we end up at SCOTUS before Chief Justice Cannon (only partly kidding!)And because of all that, any ""what to do now"" advice is pretty difficult, as everything takes months to get set up even even beyond the current lawsuits, as does applying for plan changes. Though I certainly understand people not wanting to be in non-counting forbearance in times of uncertainty.We presume that IBR is more robust against meddling by the new administration, but of course that remains to be seen. If anything I might suggest everyone with Direct Loans review 20 USC 1098e(b)(7), particularly anyone who has been on IBR previously - because of (7)(A). IBR when it comes to FFEL and consolidation advice might be even harder to gauge due to how that was implemented back in like 2012, and may also be pending the fate of the Final Rule. Query too if the one-time adjustment counts conducted by this administration will even be honored? There will be much litigation to come. Edit: typo It depends what the 8th does. Yes any specific orders as to the Final Rule, if ultimately withdrawn or rewritten by new rulemaking, would be in effect only until superseded by those changes to the CFR, which will moot the underlying lawsuits. And any legal findings they promulgate (for example as discussed interpreting the intent and effect of the 1993 ICR statute), would only have to be followed by district courts in the 8th Circuit. Now, those findings might be persuasive authority in other circuits, but will not be binding. And with this 3-judge panel, I have a feeling many other circuits will not follow their reasoning, unless forced to by SCOTUS.I completely agree that student loan forgiveness generally, and many aspects of the more generous plans (zero dollar ""payments""!) are a tough sell, and that was true even before the center apparently red shifted on us. Small correction: Is it not *underwater* basket weaving that those freeloading Ivy Leaguers are spending our tax dollars on?You might be right about the blue states, I've been chewing on that. As a matter of fighting the Trump agenda, certainly a few state AG's will want to, but I'm uncertain as to the issue of standing. Maybe more likely to be individual borrower-plaintiffs, backed by student loan legal advocacy groups, and state AG's and liberal think tanks may just file amicus briefs. Venue may be better though, as to both district courts and circuits, and will probably be chosen carefully. In fact to look ahead at where we are going, it might be interesting to go back and see who may have sued DeVos and/or the servicers during the prior White House.The issues will be exactly the same albeit from a different angle of course: That the Trumpy Department of Education's rulemaking and actions misinterpret the law or exceed the authority granted by Congress. Thanks! It's way too complex to memorize, but I'm moderately experienced at reading briefs, judge's opinions, and looking things up. I've also saved a lot of these PDF's to a folder, and a great many lay out legal and procedural backgrounds, some of which go all the way back to the beginning with the 1965 HEA. You just have to get a sense of who is correctly laying out what has come before, and who is bending things with propaganda. Hint: mostly red state AG's and conservative think tanks. And the 8th Circuit! But the District Court rulings are pretty good in that respect even if the rulings partly went against the Department. I recommend them. Glad my ramblings are useful to some though! I got help here a year ago with consolidation, so once these lawsuits and injunctions landed I figured I could try to give back. Sort of a hobby that's similar to my day job. Depressingly true. A trifecta of control means the underlying law can be changed, eliminating pesky things like APA fights over authority and the courts blocking Department-created regulations (using newly-invented doctrines or otherwise). Also true that arcane student loan law, only occasionally making the headlines, may hurt quite a few and yet still be the least of our upcoming national tragedies. Some suits will still happen though, and I doubt they will be able to make the code fully bulletproof. Also likely to only be prospective, so grandfathering may end up critical. I don't know if everyone's Google search results are matching (blame the algorithm), but I just threw in ""lawsuits against betsy devos department of education"" and hoo boy, that's quite a list. Including by advocacy organizations and at least one state AG. I might try to look a few up at some point to see how they fared, but as DeVos apparently set records for being sued, categorizing them all would be exhausting. And while no prophet, I see much exhaustion on the horizon."

Of all of the things, a ""tech"" line-item in an online class makes total sense. It would be more understandable if you were complaining about a gym fee or something for an online class. Because the university is just expanding to fill a vacuum, that's the natural behavior of an organization. It's not ideal, but it's not shocking that an organization would want to accept as much money as banks are willing to throw at them when offered. with people who are just as skilledHaving attended both community college and a university, there isn't parity between them for everything.There are absolutely subjects where you can get a fine education from a community college, but they're not totally interchangeable with universities when it comes to complex topics. It depends on how the school budget is laid out. It quickly gets complicated when you've got five different departments with different budget codes working on different things.Generally speaking, at a university ""a professor teaching an online class"" is going to have involvement from the professor themselves, their college within the university, potentially their college's internal IT, the university IT, the university admissions department, and any other stuff like GRAs for the class or whatever. And that's just from the student's side. On the professor's side there's college and university people involved for payroll, benefits, facilities, and various other stuff. And each of those different departments handles things differently. It wouldn't be shocking to have some aspect of university IT outside the normal billing and handling things with a fee that changes depending on if it's an online class vs an in-person one or whatever. There's a feedback loop. One aspect of ""the quality of students those schools churn out"", from the perspective of people comparing one school with another, is the quality of research papers that the university produces. Because undergrad educations aren't everything, grad school and PhD programs are also a thing, and they tend to be easier to differentiate than undergrads that are churned out. No, that's the fundamental aspiration of science. Research for the sake of research is what science is all about; just learning new things about the universe and seeing what they mean and can be used for. There are times when you're trying to work towards something specific, but a lot of great innovations have come from either undirected research or research attempting to work on another topic and accidentally developing a different application. It's one of those things that varies wildly. I did all of my foreign language and English credits (and a couple other minor things) at a community college to reduce the cost and load of filling those same requirements at the university I went to. I had some classes at CC where the professor was serious and expected decent work from the class, but I also had others where the professor clearly cared less about the class than the students did and was just clocking in to get their paycheck. University professors seemed less variable. Yeah, that's the kind of financial illiteracy that kills people. You can't *actually* afford to pay the minimum payment on a loan, you'll be paying it off for forever. The minimum payment is for ""crap, I had a super bad month and finances are tight""; you need to be paying down the principle of the loan in general. Depends on where they moved to and what financial treaties that country has with the US regarding outstanding debt. Some countries might even refuse to let you move there at all if they suspect you're just moving to try and evade debt (that sort of person isn't generally the kind of person that countries want to recruit). So, you could probably get away with it if you're moving to Somalia or whatever, but much of western Europe would probably garnish your wages for the loans if they got a court-order for doing so from the US."
AffectionatePause152,1.8853808378838286,0.0,1.8853808378838286,Positive,"""1% is too Socialist""- every Republican in office Student loans become due after graduation when most people make the least money they will make in their careers. As a result, people make minimum payments at the very beginning of their loan terms, and then they settle into a lifestyle where it becomes very difficult to increase their payments. Because most major corporations only give 3-4% raises per year, and due to the fact that the cost of living goes up 2-3% per year (or more), its not easy to allocate more cash toward paying off loans when someone gets a raise. This is a systemic issue that makes paying off large loans very challenging without a significantly large infusion of cash (marriage or a job change with a significant raise) or a significantly large reduction in lifestyle (moving in with parents or some other co-habitation).This causes the interest on the large balances to grow significantly, making the whole thing a rat race that is very hard to win in America. The solution is for taxes to provide free or low cost state education. It's not a pipe dream: this was the way it used to be in the 1960s. What we do instead now is force young students to self fund their education (federally, on interest) to enable older and current tax payers to pay a little less on their state taxes.I swear if Republicans could find a way to charge interest on Kindergarteners and bill them after high school, they would do it in a heartbeat if it saved them $100 a year. For every problem, there is a solution. Perhaps you can try to answer the questions yourself while being as creative as possible. That's one option. The underlying problem is that living costs are too high for college students. Loans just makes the problem worse because of interest. Perhaps the Feds can step in and instead of loans for every student (which have to be dished out again and again) just pay a single cost for a no-frills dorm building with very simple accommodations. Like 6 per room. But lots of shared space for actually working and studying (like libraries). Since costs are too high, there seems to be an imbalance somewhere where supply is not meeting demand and it's only being masked with the easy disbursement of loans. It's a very inefficient way of meeting the need when building actual structures to meet the needs would have a shared benefit that lasts longer. Food is food. We have lots of farms and subsidies going to farmers (big corporations) anyway. Perhaps we need to get the farmers to supply something for those subsidies they're getting. It's not fair. It doesn't have to be fair. We give all sorts of benefits to the military such as food, housing, etc. It's about meeting a national need at a reasonable cost, and that's it. We have to get this idea of fairness out of our minds. No tax or benefit on any group over any other has EVER been fair, but they are everywhere. It's only when we talk about helping students when all this hogwash about fairness creeps up. The point is that it's about priorities. We spend $40,000 on fuel per 3 hr training mission for our military pilots. How do I know? A pilot told me. Now, no one is saying that we don't need to train our pilots, but god damn that's a lot on money day after day. We surely have the means of creating shelter for student at a low cost. It's not that hard."
TldrDev,1.8098370795886674,0.0,1.8098370795886674,Positive,"You can break 800 with just credit cards and pay no interest at all. This is bad advice. There are several factors that make up your credit score. Namely, your payment history, your card usage, your available credit, and credit age. There are other short term indicators like hard credit pulls that will negatively impact your score for awhile.Literally none of that has anything to do with interest or predicting your profitability. That doesn't even really make sense for the bank to do. What it shows the bank is the risk of the loan, which does trickle into the assumed profitability, but you paying interest really has nothing to do with this, nor do long term loans. Your credit score determines risk. On a chart, you can draw a line between the statistical likelihood this loan will fail vs interest rate and that will be the profitability of the loan. Your credit score is only a risk metric.To answer your question, what influances your credit are the factors I've laid out here. The way you can break 800 is by having a suitable number of accounts through various lenders, typically around 25ish open accounts. These can be credit cards, mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc.You want 10 years of history of good on-time payments, and you want about $60,000-$80,000 in available credit, of which, you use under 10%. You do not need to carry a balance month to month. You do not need a statement balance reported, just a valid payment.That takes awhile to do for most people. You need to steadily increase your available credit over time. If you do it too fast, you'll receive a lot of hard credit pulls on your account, which lenders will read as you nearing financial difficulty and offer you shit deals or even deny you.The way I did it was I got one really good cash back card for each sector of my life. I started with the Amazon card through chase, which gave me 5% cash back on amazon shit. I did this with Costco and an airline miles card, and various other stuff I regularly use.I basically run my entire life through those cards. I'll pay for everything I can wherever applicable to get the best deal. The day before the statement posts, I'll pay off the entire balance of the card. Once a year, I call and ask for a credit limit increase. Because I run my life through those cards, I get a significant amount of cash back every month, and the payment processor is happy to give me an increase. Literally everybody wins. I did that for a decade. 6 figure credit limit. Like maybe 2% reported usage, max. You'll break 800 without owning a house or paying a dollar in interest. 2k is an excellent start. Use the card every month, buy a few things on the card, and then immediately pay them off. It only took me a few years to start with a 2k secured card.After about a year or two with a secured card, they'll refund you your deposit and increase your credit limit to 4k. You should, around that period, be in the low mid 700s. Try to avoid carrying a significant balance. You want under 10% usage. That's the goal. If you have above a 10% usage you'll see a drop in your credit score, but if the next month, you pay off the entire balance prior to your statement posting, you'll see a large increase in your score.That's what you want to do right before you apply for your next card. Pay it all off, jack your score up as much as you can, apply for the best card you can (the Amazon Chase card is a really good card to start with here). Once you get to the mid 700s, apply for that card. Use that card for your day to day expenses, and then pay it off before the statement date. Keep the old card, always buying maybe a stick of gum once a month to keep the old card active, but use the better rewards card as much as you can, always paying it off every month.If you keep doing that, let's say for a few years, Chase will eventually increase your credit limit on the Amazon card to maybe 10k.Do this for a few years.Once you find a really good card that you like, the following card after doing this for awhile, you'll be approved and be given something like a 15k credit limit immediately on the new card. You'll start receiving offers on legitimately good cards at that point. Good airline miles. Decent cash back cards. Each time you get a new one you'll get a decent 5 figure credit limit on those cards. At that point you've played the game successfully, and you will eventually break 800, and you'll be maximizing all the rewards.It doesn't take long to go from 2k to 20k of available credit. A few years at most. Going from 20k to 100k at that point was opening 2 or 3 additional cards for shit you care about. Not all at once, over time finding a card you like and getting it.DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR BOOMER PARENTS ABOUT HAVING TO CARRY A BALANCE, YOU DO NOT NEED TO CARRY A BALANCE ON THE CARD. Just a valid payment needs to be made."
ironboy157,1.7867914861056822,0.0,1.7867914861056822,Positive,"I think the political dysfunction around student loans has been a net benefit to borrowers since March of 2020. By the time the SAVE plan gets axed( if it does), it will be 5 years of no interest for many people. The next four years will probably go back to the status quo, making payments and many people's balances growing while on IDRs. I think there is no chance there will be more forgiveness even if Harris wins. With that said, the balances will still exist and they will grow. The ballooning student debt is never going to be repaid. So as long as the problem exists, some politicians will attempt to forgive some loans. I imagine the democratic nominee in 2028 will be espousing some type of forgiveness. My personal strategy has been unchanged. I pay whatever the lowest legal payment is and I invest my savings in the S&P500. Maybe there will be some attempt to reduce interest, forgive some balances, or something else. In the mean time, whatever extra payments I could make are growing in the S&P. If there is some financial crises, there is a higher chance on action of student loans. Some people started repaying, it depends which plan you were on and which tax year they used to calculate your payment. There are many borrowers whose SAVE plan payments was Zero or very near Zero. Additionally, since income verification is also constantly delayed, the income being used to calculate payments can be from 2019. Its all kind of luck.If Trump is elected, and SAVE is eliminated, the earliest I could see interest accruing again would be march of 2025, so 5 years after the covid pause. Maybe he would turn it on in February. Well people do kill themselves over student loans, but federal student loans are not the same as owing to a loanshark.The balances do have an effect on your life, but much of that can be minimized. If the 20/25 year forgiveness is eliminated, I think it will hurt a lot of people. My strategy isn't even a bet on a greater return. It is more ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"".I would rather have $1 in savings than give that dollar to my loan balance. If i could take a 100K federal student loan today and just put the 100K in the S&P, I would.Now the situation for the past few years has been even better, not only has the interest been Zero for some people- some of the time, but there was high inflation. So value of that debt has been reduced.This is the type of random event you get to take advantage of if you don't try to pay down the balance. Now many people feel immense stress from owning debt, but federal student loan debt is among the best debt you could own. Well when you buy the S&P you aren't trying to beat the market.....Inflation is good. It means the value of your debt decreases over time and salaries tend to go up at least with adjustments around inflation. Any person who has sent a single dollar ""attacking their student loans"" for the past 5 years have just lost money. The play, in hindsight, was to take every dollar you would put toward loans and invest it. Since the student loan pause started in 2020, the S&P is up like 250%. If you were capable of making the standard 10 year payment, and put that payment every month in the S&P500 for the past 4.5 years, your balance is higher than the loan balance. So you could now pay off the whole loan amount. That was a game I won. I don't suggest relying on loan forgiveness, just being open to it, if it does happen. Debt, in general can be good. Federal student loans are essentially the best kind of debt to have, except for maybe mortgage debt. When there are recessions, guess what? The government becomes more ""kind"" to borrowers. If I owed 100K today and had 100K in cash, would I pay off my loans? Absolutely not. Keep your 100K, invest it and make the monthly payments, and that would be without the interest pause. The market goes up and down, but guess what, you never have to sell. Telling people they need to attack their loans isn't the most helpful advice. Some people are stressed by having any debt, they should pay their loans as fast as possible. For anyone who is comfortable seeing big numbers on a screen, using your money in the most productive way is the way to go, and that is often not paying the loans any faster than the law requires. The morbid benefit of federal student loans is they are cancelled when you die. So if you have some savings and you die, your family gets your savings but not your debt.But you are always more valuable to your family alive then dead, just no point in paying down federals loans rather then building savings. I am not a lawyer so IDK the odds that it gets removed. I just read the discussions from one of the cases. The other concern is even if the 20/25 year forgiveness stays around a republican administration can do everything in their power to not enact it. With IDRs you only have to pay 10-15% of your income. If you want to be as morbid as possible, the best thing you can do for your family is pay your 10-15% tax, save whatever you can in 401Ks/HSAs or whatever account you can. Then at the 20-25 year mark you get the tax bomb. You won't be able to pay that and the IRS will make you a deal or they do something that is better than a loan shark.You are always more valuable to your family alive both in the time they spend with you and the financial support you provide. There are plenty of people who currently have a balance higher than they would have repaid with the standard plan, i think those people may be ok with that rule. I don't they would back track capitalized interest, but there are a few borrowers who would benefit front his structure."
milespoints,1.734339316624781,0.0,1.734339316624781,Positive,"I think you would benefit more from some context. The current ""problem"" with student loans from a public policy perspective is that the federal govt has, for too long, written a blank check to universities by being willing to lend ""whatever the schooling costs"". This has resulted in amounts borrowed and, as a result, student loan balances skyrocketing. Everyone agrees on this, republicans and democrats alike. The democratic solution has been to try to decrease monthly loan payments and diverge total amount paid from total amount borrowed. Basically, with SAVE and the like, it matters less and less how much you borrow, as you just make (very affordable) income based repayments and eventually the remaining balance just gets forgiven. This would probably result in an ever increasing subsidy in the form of forgiveness (schools could keep charging more and more, and there is no real cost control or limit). Note that there a lot of things going for this policy, but it does introduce a type of moral hazard. You can keep borrowing more and more, and since it all gets forgiven (and most people do not pay taxes on the amount forgiven) you don't really pay anything extra.The republican solution is to go completely the other direction. Republicans do not like open-ended government subsidies. Republicans want to make loans MORE burdensome, not less, in order to incentivize people to borrow less and to incentivize schools to charge less. This proposal achieves this by keeping the payments affordable but getting rid of that 20-25 year forgiveness get out of jail free card. To me there is an intuitive fairness to say ""Everyone pays back the amount they borrowed and the interest they signed up for"". Fair is square. You borrowed the money. It also caps loan amounts to prevent universities from continuing to jack up tuition. So is this good policy? God no. If this entire thing has taught us much is that your average 18 year old is, financially speaking, noy very sharp. Most 18 year olds do not ""respond to financial incentives"" like that. They will continue to borrow as much as they need to graduate from their school of choice, and then just make payments forever, until they die. Even worse, because this plan caps loan amounts, it would make people go borrow from private lenders, where there is no IDR. While there is some sort of inherent cost control included here (private lenders probably won't lend you $500k for your gender studies PhD or whatever, they wanna get repaid), it's not gonna do much (there is still a lot of room for americans to pay more for loans)But if you think, like most republicans, that the problem with student loan policy is that the government has subsidies that are just too generous, this bill fixes that. You can't really allow student loan debt to be discharged like that. Most young graduates have no assets. So it would quickly become standard process to just file chapter 7 immediately after college graduation (no assets to lose anyway, and very few people need clean credit to buy a house or the like at age 24). Then start rebuilding credit, and be in tip top shape to get any loan you might want when the BK falls off in 7 years, which would be like age 28 I mean, i am not a big fan of this bill for all the reasons mentioned, but those two shouldn't be mutually exclusive. You can have both accessible and cost-effective education! My own opinion is that the GOP plan would be decent with one modification - if it would require universities to accept the capped federal student loan disbursement as payment in full for tuition and fees. In other words, you either take federal loans or not. If you do, you can't ""balance bill"" the student. This is how federal NSF fellowships for PhD students work Why do you think that? Tbh we can bring back the entire cost control that we used to have by just including a provision in the loan terms that the school must accept the federal loan disbursement as payment in full My guess is that republicans don't wanna do that because it would decimate the private student loan industry I mean, the current 20-25 year IDR forgiveness is essentially that, just with a longer timeline. Again, the point is that you don't want to incentivize people to strategically declare bankruptcy to shed their student loans. Being able to do that at even 10 years after graduation would probably result in tons of people going that route Yes. And people were abusing it, which is why we got rid of that. Did you actually read your MPN?I am pretty sure it's very specifically laid out there in what circumstances the interest can capitalize"

I had a plan going into college: I wanted to become a High School English teacher. I got a lot of valuable experience: I was an RA in the dorms, I was a teaching assistant, I worked during two summer sessions on-campus for the housing department, visited local High Schools as part of field work experiences, and got some student teaching in. I went through a lot during undergrad. Especially as a first-generation student. I think my ""plan"" was established as a result of merely just passion, interest, inspiration, etc. I found teaching to be interesting and fulfilling work because of the amazing teachers I had in HS. I think I felt so pressured to go to college and trying to figuring what the f--- I was going to do with my life that, as a consequence, I didn't think really intentionally and deep about WHY I wanted to be a teacher in the first place. After student teaching, I learned over time that teaching wasn't meant for me. It was a hard decision to make, but I made it for myself. A lot of people in my family were frustrated and shocked about that decision, but I had to jump ship and find something else I truly felt was my calling. So, after spending a lot of time reflecting on my college experience, what I did, and what I did WELL, I noticed a re-occurring pattern in mentoring, coaching, and being a leader for my peers. Including folks like me who made the courageous move to go to university-the first in their families. Being a leader for college students (e.g. Resident Assistant in the halls) was something I grew through personally and professionally. I was a role model for many people, and many looked up to me. I learned how to be responsible for others' safety, belonging, and transition to college life. Cool stuff! I asked myself a question: how can I do this professionally? So, to put this question into action, I will be attending grad school in the fall to pursue my masters in student affairs. This will allow me to build upon meaningful experiences that helped me grow and others grow. College is a journey, and it's full of self-realization, personal growth, vulnerability, mistakes, and challenges. I am entering graduate school with genuine commitment, confidence, and intention--something I didn't do going into college. I did take out loans. Mostly, I took out small federal loans through financial aid. I had to take out a little extra for housing my freshman year. I received a lot of grants. The way I look at it: my degree DID lead me somewhere. As long as your degree enables you to access meaningful work that ensures you can give back to others in deep, meaningful ways, then you have won. That is how I look at the ""worth"" surrounding a college degree with loans taken out. I am looking forward to my next chapter. Your own journey may lead you to pursue something completely different after college, and that is OKAY. For a long time, I thought that after college we have to remain obligated to stick to something for the rest of our lives--even if it doesn't work out for us in the end. Whatever you do, be intentional about your goals. As long as you use your degree to pursue something meaningful, then taking out loans for it is worth it. Good luck, my friend! I hope this lengthy perspective helped."
burner12077,1.6910936672701005,0.0,1.6910936672701005,Positive,"The reality is that 100k is sort of on the high end if you use all the resources out there. But not everyone knows this. If you use every single form of financial aid and apply for every scholarship possible, and also take care to be frugal and work part time while schooling (which actually statistically increases your chances of success) then most people who aren't in an ivy league school should graduate with a much smaller student loan. I know a lot of people who managed like 20-50k. I know a few who did this and got thier entire degree free. Most people who complain about the cost of education in america either don't know or refuse to see this path. Probably graduating debt free is difficult, but anyone can rent a bedroom instead of an apartment, 100k may be ""bellow the national average"" but the average loan is for dumb people. Get your AA at a community college that works closely with a university for 30% of the university price, maybe live with your parents for that since any community college will do. Work part time making 20-30k a year to reduce the loan taken, and lastly some scholarships are hard, but most people qualify for financial aid, and many states have some sort of bright future scholarship that you are prety much garunteed if you have a decent grade. You do all these things and be careful that 100k can get cut in half, or even turn into 30k prety easily. I would add that your source has students living on campus. Which in my experience makes university far far more expensive. This forces you to overpay for thier trash rooms with shared quarters and also get thuer overpriced meal plan. Normally you can rent a bedroom out in town and cook for yourself in the kitchen for waaaaay cheaper. Tuition might be somewhat of a fixed cost, but cost of living is far from it. Students just refuse to think outside the box! Think about it. For the cost of one semesters campus living, you could probably buy a camper trailer and have it parked at a campsite with full hookup for $150 - $250 a month and be set for the rest of your time (don't say you don't have a truck, you can rent a pickup from home depot for under $50) I'm going to address this point by point. So to make sure I understand you, your point is that college costs aren't exorbitant. And then you are listing sixish different things people have to do as workarounds to try and get past the exorbitant price tag on college tuitions. Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. I never said it's a good system, I just said that it's not terribly hard to get away with less than a six figure loan and shooting for ""average"" in anything shouldn't be the goal. Also living on campus from my example is ""renting a room"", generally it's a shared room in a dorm. So you aren't cutting costs from that option there. Many people don't live within commuting distance to live at home and go to school. And if they do, then they will need transportation, so that costs money too. Holy shit, renting a room is cheaper than campus, that's been my point all allong. The study you referenced used data from students living in dorms on meal plans which grossly inflates college costs. The state university in my area isn't a huge city. Most students that rent bedrooms like I'm saying buy a $500 scooter. But keys be honest. This is america. Love it or hate it, you needed a car anyways. How will you ever get anywhere without a car? Needing a vehicle is not really an extra expense, and most kids probably already had a vehicle going into college. Damn near everyone I know did.If you can find a part time job for $15/hr (good luck but let's play it out) and can average 15 hours a week every week for the entire year and never have to take any significant time off for finals and stuff, then you made a whopping $11,700 for the year. Not to mention, like I said, intense programs often discourage you from working so you can ""focus on your studies"". Hopefully you don't mind starving half the time and utter exhaustion from working and going to school full time at the same time!You say ""good luck on $15/hr"" as if it's some exorbant amount. The federal min wage will be $15/hr next year, but that doesn't really matter, it's hardly a hard price floor already, every mcdonalds in my area starts at $16/hr, and speaking as someone who does 55hr work weeks and halftime college work. It's not that fucking hard, I still live a very fulfilling life with freetime. You can find a job paying $15-20 hr doing 20 hours a week all day every day and that's more than manageable on a full-time schedule. The goal with a part time job is not to get away debt free, it's just to be able to have enough cash to keep Most or all of your living expenses off the loan, 1500 month is realistic I think.Associate's degrees are great, particularly for trade jobs, but increasingly, jobs want a bachelors. Even for jobs that shouldn't need one. It's stupid. So if you don't want to go into a trade the associates isn't a viable option for you.Are you reading anything I'm writing? I didn't suggest only getting an AA. I suggested getting your AA at 25-33% of the university cost from a community college before transferring. Your bachelor's will still have a university name.... by doing this you cut tens of thousands from your tuition cost, and if you can do it while living with family, you probably save another ten thousand there. Many people do this. It saves money, it works. I'm curently doing it with my AA for my degree in finance, the community college I'm in works directly with out local state university, so as long as my GPA is good. I'm basically garunteed acceptance. Community college is an option and one I advocate for with younger generations in our current educational climate, but you aren't guaranteed acceptance into a university after. So you might just be screwing yourself if you pay out for a community college and later you can't get into a university for the degree you are pursuing. Your right, but like I just outlined, many community colleges work directly with universities. And I might add you aren't garunteed acceptance from high school either. Instead of blaming the people being shit on for not bringing an umbrella, we need to focus on the exploitation happening to our young people in the form of education. More and more jobs are requiring degrees, any degree. So people entering the work force are just screwed if they want to be successful at most careers. And we need people to be able to enter into all careers, not just the ones that have a lower education requirement. The cost of tuition in PUBLIC universities is exploitative. They need to be available and accessible to the public. It's literally what they are for. We have to stop gatekeeping higher education behind money. And we have to stop calling people doing their best to educate themselves ""stupid"" or ""gullible"". It's a damn diversion tactic to keep costs high while the plebeians fight each other. And you are falling right for it.I'm not falling for shit my friend. I agree with you. The system is trash. But it is what it is and it's not changing. Look how hard Biden has tried and failed to make a difference on it. When I'm presented with an issue like this I ask myself ""what can I control?"" Guess what, I can't control the tuition rate, I can't control that AA degrees costs are inflated with Gen Ed's that were mostly covered in high school. But I can control all the stuff I outlined. I'm sorry you thought I was trashing on people who are willing to roll over belly up and accept a six figure loan because ""that's what it is I'll wait for the government to fix it"" I was just trying to show that there are ways to mitigate how much you put on your loan.Universities are exploitative, employers do have unfair requirements, yes the government is giving us the shaft, but that's not what we are discussing, we are discussing the elements in our lives we have control over. You talk about plebians fighting eachother with the inference that that is me. That also makes you a plebian in your own example So you think sharing a dorm room and living on the campus meal plan is preferable to a camper? I would pick the camper in a heartbeat. Loads of safe parks, a comparable amount of space to a dorm room, and PRIVACY. But that's just one example. Renting a bedroom in a decent house with other students is still cheaper than dorms and better quality of life. Why do you insist dorms are the only way to go? It honestly seems like the worst option to me. I always hated that style of living."
Deutsche_Bank_AG,1.6774092120708408,0.0,1.6774092120708408,Positive,"Student loans are simple interest, whereas market returns are compounding. I have $300k in federal student loans at ~6% interest. Total payoff amount on a 30-year extended repayment plan is ~$512k. Instead of paying the student loans off, I invested $300k (the loan balance) in VOO in a taxable brokerage account. My bet (not really a bet, it's just math) was that the compounding market returns would outpace the simple interest. Have been right so far--current value of that taxable brokerage is ~$500k after about 6-7 years (i.e., almost equal to the total payoff amount on the loans). I expect that brokerage account to double a few more times while I continue to make regular payments on the loans. Best move I ever made. Student loans can be great leverage if you use them right. Yeah--I'm a lawyer too, though have been in biglaw so was easier to pile up the initial $300k. Some people are just so uncomfortable with debt, but if you follow the math it usually makes sense to pay off simple interest loans slowly and invest instead. The usual doomsday hypo people scared of debt offer up is ""what if you lose your job and stocks are down"". My response is: (i) you can easily get a hardship, etc., deferment or reduction in payments on federal loans in that situation so are pretty protected generally and (ii) worst case, you'd be selling stocks at a loss (maybe) to cover your loan payments until you get a new job--how long could that last even worst case? A couple years? And even in that situation, it's not like you'd be selling everything, you'd just be reverse DCA-ing out of the account until your cash flow returns and probably wouldn't be underwater forever on the stocks anyway. This all requires being comfortable with a little risk, but I don't think it's THAT much risk. Folks can be way too conservative with student loan debt in my opinion. ~$200k for me for a law degree (down from ~$260k initially--I paid off $60k aggressively before I settled on the strategy above) plus ~$100k for spouses MBA. They were gambles, but we don't come from any money so had nothing to lose really. Made a point to work to get into top schools so the odds of it paying off would be better. If you buy a share for $100, and over the next year the value goes up 10%, it's worth $110 at the end of the year. If the value goes up 10% again the next year, it's worth $121 (i.e., you get a return on previous returns).Simple interest doesn't compound like that. If you take a loan for $100 at 10% simple interest, you pay $10 each year the loan is outstanding (assuming no principal payments)--i.e., you don't pay interest on capitalized interest.The difference gets bigger the longer the periods. Take it out 30 years and, using the above two examples: (i) the one share would be worth $1,745, but (ii) the balance on the loan would be only $400. Yeah--some people are fine with ignoring the math and forgoing steep, relatively low-risk upside for ""peace of mind"". I'd rather have more money in the mid to long run and move up my FIRE timeline. To each their own. Generally yes, but you'd have to check your loan documents to confirm. A lot of the features and protections that come with federal student loans don't apply to private student loans, but they usually are still simple interest. 1. I mean, I also didn't have $300k to put in initially. I just kept saving and adding cash until I hit $300k cost basis--it took about 4 years, since I was following the normal order of operations before you get to filling up a taxable brokerage account (i.e., maxing HSA, pre-tax 401k, etc.). I think the math holds at any principal amount, unless it's so small that it's not with the trouble. I think $100k is probably enough to where it's worth the trouble. $25k? Would probably just pay it off. But that's arbitrary. If you're asking about what simple interest rate makes it stop making sense, I'm not sure. I think the highest federal student loan interest rate ever was 10.5%. Total repayment amount over 30 years at that rate on $100k would be $415k. Equity index returns on $100k at 7% over 30 years would compound to $761k. So a margin of $364k. And the 7% is the usual inflation-adjusted average return (whereas the student loans won't track up with inflation), so that's even probably too conservative.2. Nope. Depends on your HYSA but probably--I don't keep much in those, though, just my emergency fund. All other free cash goes into index funds.And yes--you just have to enroll in DRIP via your brokerage and they'll automatically reinvest dividends. Dividends are just part of the total return on the ETF. The return gap between simple interest debt and compounding market returns is huge over long periods. So yeah if you value whatever else you're considering more than that, then sure. Just taking my situation, assuming 7% average annual return on the $500k invested currently over the next ~20 years I'll be paying off the loans, that will be worth $1.9mm. The total payoff amount for the student loans will still have been $512k. That's $1.4mm in upside, and would require a really high present value on the ""some things"" you mention to make it make sense to forgo that.I generally try to avoid letting non-financial considerations impact my financial decisions. But like I said--to each their own."

If PSLF forgives all your loans then IDR forgiveness doesn't really matter for you specifically going forward Let's look at the actual employer requirements for PSLF as per **Qualifying Employment** Qualifying employment for PSLF isn't about the specific job that you do for your employer--it's about who you work for. Use our employer search tool to see if your employer qualifies for PSLF.

I would recheck your loan type and repayment plan and do the math to see if PSLF is the best route forward for you to handle your loans What did you see in the details for your PSLF Form? You said you applied and they said you didn't qualify *yet* but did they certify a payment count? Some x out of 120 payments number?

Ford Federal Direct Loan Program Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities Statement 16) REPAYING YOUR LOAN The repayment period for each Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan that you receive begins on the day after your grace period ends. We will notify you of the date your first payment is due. You must make payments on your loan even if you do not receive a bill or repayment notice. You must repay the principal amount of your loan, plus any interest charged on the loan in accordance with the Act. The principal amount that you owe, and are required to repay, is the total of all loan disbursements that are made (except for any disbursements that you reduce or cancel), plus any unpaid interest that is capitalized and added to the principal balance, as authorized under the Act. You must generally repay all of your Direct Loans under the same repayment plan. There are **two types of repayment plans: traditional repayment plans and income-driven repayment plans.** We will ask you to choose a repayment plan before your loans enter repayment. If you do not choose a repayment plan, we will place you on the Standard Repayment Plan, which may require you to make a higher monthly payment than other repayment plans. If you choose a repayment plan that reduces your monthly payment amount by extending the period of time you have to repay your loans or by basing your payment on your income, you will likely pay more in interest over time than you would pay on another repayment plan.There is more detail on the PDF but suffice to say **access to income-driven repayment plans that have built-in forgiveness as part of the repayment plan are built in to the loan agreement so anyone using an IDR plan is exactly following the terms and conditions of the loan they signed up for**. Access to PSLF is *also* clearly called out in the MPNThe borrowers *are* repaying their loans as per the loan terms. IDR plans and forgiveness programs are clearly written into the contract.

There are multiple forgiveness programs happening concurrently, and the big forgiveness groups recently are under:* The one-time IDR Adjustment after 20-25 years worth of repayment which people on this sub reference as ""golden emails"" * Starting Feb 2024 some have early forgiveness for low balances under SAVE (this is the $12k thing, it's 10 years worth of IDR payments *if* your original principal balance was under $12k and you're on the SAVE plan)* Others are getting Borrower Defense discharges, like the recent Art Institutes group discharge though it's worth noting that Borrower Defense to Repayment is a preexisting and ongoing program* Federal loan forgiveness/discharge programs are all listed here which includes but is not limited to PSLFIf you don't qualify for any of these programs *yet* you can still get yourself set up on the right trajectory. Public service employers and/or signing up for an IDR plan. The linear flow of time will cover the rest"
kungfuenglish,1.5342444712841008,0.0,1.5342444712841008,Positive,"Why isolate it to federal loans and only up to 100k??These exclusionary policies and limits are bs.And truthfully, democrats have solidified themselves over time as the party of excluding certain people based on arbitrary limits and that has pushed a lot of people away from the Democratic Party. It's an aura of unfairness. In a free in state university system, how do you propose the cost of living is handled?As it is, in state tuition is 2000-3000/semester = $6000/year. But people take out 30k/year in loans. Why? Because 25k is for cost of living. What's your solution to that? This whole thread reads as ""fuck you I want mine"" though. Why not give $10k to every American instead?No. It sounds like you want 30-50k for yourselves instead because of arbitrarily getting student loans. Which actually is advantageous to you in life. It's exclusionary and regressive. But fuck everyone else get yours right? You deserve it more. don't understand the authors reasoning at allI suspect it's ""republicans bad"" and not much deeper than that. Would this include loans that we have already refinanced and consolidated? If my tuition was free my student loan burden would be about 250k instead of 350k for 4 years of undergrad (20k) and 4 years of med school (80k). The rest is cost of living expenses that pay rent and food and stuff that is covered by student loans. Do you want taxes to pay for people's cost of living too?If not, how do you rectify this deficit?Undergrad loans for state school are 20k/ year: only 5 of that is tuition and fees. Even if living in dorms is required. It's still paying for rent. Why pay for that but not off campus? That's not fair. Pay for state school tuitionNot cost of livingPeople need to pay their own cost of living no matter where they live. They shouldn't get free housing just because they are in college. Why shouldn't non college attendees get free housing?Offer loans for cost of living. Anyone can take out personal loans for that amount. So these are a better value. But have to be paid back. It's not a choice to ""live"" though. Why should some living be free and other living not be? living costs are too high for college studentsDude living costs are living costs. Living costs are high for everyone. That's the entire point. Why should tax money pay for college students to live for free and not others?And supply food to students because farmers get subsidies? Ok fine. Why doesn't everyone else get free food too then?If you want to pay for cost of living for college students for 4 years out of taxes then that's a fine platform. But you have to justify why that select group of adult humans in America get free living expenses for 4 years and not the rest of America. You want to give every person 80k to cover 4 years living expenses when they turn 18? Go for it. That you could actually justify and reason. No reason it should be only for college students. I'm being serious. Why should college dorm living be free? And food too? I seriously don't understand why it should be free for some people to live but not others. Why students and not young adults that are working instead and can't make enough to cover costs?It doesn't have to be fair but it HAS to be justified. And no, WE don't have to ""get this idea of fairness out of our minds"". You need to get it into your mind. Until the people of the USA vote for unfairness, it doesn't get to just be implemented against the will of the people. The people voted against unfair exclusionary policies like this. So if you want to make change you run on policies people will vote for. But it's NOT a part of tuition. Why do dorm stayers get free food but people who live at home with their parents don't?What do you do about spending money? Do you give an allowance too? Why should taxes go towards spending money for others?Spending money is part of room and board calculations right now. Because a 30k student loan payment is like $50/moA 30k car payment over 5 years is like $600/moIf you paid 600/mo to your student loans it would be paid off in 5 years too. So to pay it off in double the time as a car loan it costs half as much. Yes. I'm specifically referring to the income based plans. Or even just 25 year repayment plan that is offered without income based plans. Many people opt for those so of course they aren't paid off in 5 years. Paying $50-100/mo isn't going to get you very far. It's like paying the minimum on a credit card bill. Yea probably still most common. Doesn't mean that ""many"" don't take the plans. Many does not mean most. But the real answer to the parent question is: most people WHO COMPLAIN ON REDDIT take the income driven plans. And then obviously fall behind because they never have any plan to make up for it and in 5 years wonder why their balance is higher than it started. MOST people coming out of college get a degree and job that pays well enough to pay off loans in 10 years. So they don't have the problem recited in the OP and never post about it on Reddit either."
baby-luvs-gorgonzola,1.5180853392105595,0.0,1.5180853392105595,Positive,"I'm not sure whether to throw in the towel and hurl my (very small) life's savings at my balance, or to maintain patience and wait for potential forgiveness. Been paying my undergrad + grad loans since 1998. Hoped to qualify for forgiveness based on number of years in repayment, but no one on either the lender side or student aid dot gov side knows anything or has much info at all. The answer varies by the person I talk to, time of day, etcUPDATE DEC 2024: I made my periodic call to both student aid dot gov and my servicer (Nelnet) asking/begging for them to provide me my count of loan payments made since I started in 1999. Nelnet said that's student aid's job, and they are only one servicer I've had over the years, so they just don't have the number. Student aid said Nelnet should have that number for sure. I said they told me they don't have it. Their only advice was for me to ""file a complaint"" against Nelnet. I have negative, sub-zero % confidence that anyone knows that they are talking about at this point, or that I will ever procure this count, which I was originally told would be provided to me within 90 days (back in April). I feel your pain. I applied for the IDR plan in April 2024 in order to become eligible for student loan forgiveness based on number of years in repayment. And I've yet to be officially ""approved"" for IDR, even though signing up messed with my payments and I'm now paying several hundred more dollars per month under it. When I ask my lender or student aid dot gov when I'll be officially approved under the plan, and thus hopefully eligible for forgiveness, they have no idea. Yet I'm paying as if I have been approved for the plan. I'm sorry it happened to you too. I'm paying $400 more a month. The most frustrating part is that literally no one knows anything. I've been passed back and forth between studentaid and my lender and neither can even confirm how many qualifying payments I have. Or tell me when they'll know how many qualifying payments I have. Or really even tell me what exactly would make a payment ""qualifying"", because why not just count the months I've been in repayment??I feel as if I've (we've) been given a bait and switch. I am potentially qualified for forgiveness based on qualifying number of payments. However neither studentaid.gov nor my lender can provide further detail on if or when that may happen. They also cannot provide further info on the number of qualifying payments I have. Please share where you got this info. I've not been able to get any info out of either studentaid or my lender. As I understand it there is data on the positive impact student loan forgiveness would have on the economy. Hundreds of thousands of people in a financial chokehold would be freed up to buy homes, cars, etc., thus boosting the economy. A rising tide lifts all boats. In my case I'm not referring to blanket forgiveness but forgiveness based on months of qualifying payments. I signed up for IDR - which upped my monthly payment - under the pretense that the fact that I've been paying since 1998 would make me eligible for forgiveness. After I signed up and took that hit, no one knows anything. I applied for it in April 2024. The official status is still listed as ""under review"" on studentaid, however my monthly payment is higher, as if I've been approved. Previous to this I had consolidated undergrad and grad under a lender offer over a decade ago. I was told I needed to do IDR in order to qualify for loan forgiveness based on number of years in payment, so I did. Since May 2024. I was told signing up for IDR and switching my loans from consolidated back to govt would make me eligible for potential forgiveness based on years of repayment. I was told this by both studentaid and my lender. Did they lie?Also, while I've been signed up for IDR since April 2024 and paying on IDR since May 2024 my official status for IDR is still listed on my studentaid dashboard as ""pending review."" So your guess is as good as mine. It's a cluster. I'm not even sure they had income-based plans back in the 90s. Well then I was lied to. Or my enrollment in IDR was necessitated by re-enrolling in a federal plan after having consolidated with a lender decades ago. In either scenario I was most definitely told I needed to enroll in an IDR plan in order to be eligible for the look-back and further consideration for forgiveness based on time in repayment.In any case, maybe none of that matters since literally no one I've talked to at either studentgov or my lender is able to tell me 1) how many qualifying payments I have, 2) when my case might be looked at and/or evaluated for forgiveness based on my number of qualifying payments, 3) anything - they know nothing and the story changes each time I call.I am going on 7 months of calling and asking these same questions, after doing what they asked of me (flipping my loans back to fed + enrolling in an IDR plan). I feel like I've been taken for a ride, since my payments are now $400 more per month. Thank you! I hope it works out for everyone. The money I'm referring to is my emergency fund and some other basic savings. And that would cover about 30%. Save for a 401 and IRA, that's all I have. I find it helps to have empathy. People have extenuating circumstances - health issues, generational poverty, and layoffs to name but a few. Also these are not normal loans, they've been proven to be predatory and we essentially sign our financial future away when we are 18 or 19 years old and our frontal lobe isn't even fully developed, in order to try and get an education and contribute to society.Like I always say, if they had pulled this type of predatory and unethical shit with boomers' mortgages we'd have seen them rioting in the streets. I signed up for IDR based on the pretense that I would be eligible for forgiveness based on # of months of qualifying payments. Now no one can provide me with further details on that. Same. Did undergrad from 1994-1998. Been paying student loans since late 1998. Forgiveness based on # of months in repayment / # of qualifying payments (in my case). Wondered if others were feeling equally hopeless about their cases. But the govt regularly takes on huge debts in furtherance of economic growth - PPP loans, industry bailouts, etc Unfortunately I have never been eligible for this I adjusted my payment plan, increased my payments, and signed my name to this, on a false premise. I think there is a word for this. The student loan industry has been rampant with fraud, misinformation, miscalculations, miscommunication, and outright lies. If this were happening in the mortgage industry people like you would be storming the Capitol.Also, I'm sorry it so deeply triggers you that some people want to follow their dream of becoming teachers, doctors, engineers, social workers and other things that society could easily do without."

It gives us ownership of our own destiny together. He emphasizes the idea of the Whole People and Whole Education. This would include anything preschool and anything after high school, not necessarily just college, but also trade schools, etc.The rest of the letter John Adams wrote to John Jeb is absolutely fantastic. He goes on to discuss why it's important to create a system that makes people like Martin Luther King jr, Susan B Anthony, Carl Sagan, and Mr Rogers, and Washington. Good leaders should not be a product of the time, but of the educational system and culture of the people. If a country doesn't make good leaders then when that leader is gone there's no one to replace them and that culture and movement dies with them.Instead of Adoring a Washington, Mankind Should applaud the Nation which Educated him. If Thebes owes its Liberty and Glory to Epaminondas, She will loose both when he dies, and it would have been as well if She had never enjoyed a taste of either: but if the Knowledge the Principles the Virtues and Capacities of the Theban Nation produced an Epaminondas, her Liberties and Glory will remain when he is no more: and if an analogous system of Education is Established and Enjoyed by the Whole Nation, it will produce a succession of Epaminandas's.In another short work by John Adams, [Thoughts on Government]( [YouTube Reading]( he wrote about the importance of a liberal education for everyone, spared no expense.Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.100 years ago we built in mass the first major wave of highschools in the United States.[In]( 1910 18% of 15- to 18-year-olds were enrolled in a high school; barely 9% of all American 18-year-olds graduated. By 1940, 73% of American youths were enrolled in high school and the median American youth had a high school diploma.This was a dramatic shift in education and economic gain for the United States. Not all of our grandparents went to highschool until the public saw it necessary to build them. The future is going to need more local experts than ever and a high school education that was good 100 years ago just isn't going to cut it on a global scale. People will need to change careers in the future and probably more than once. We will need continuing education as a society so that people can adapt and change with the coming times. This includes ensuring that after graduating high school people are able to attend and easily afford the education they need to participate in their community.As long as a person puts in their work to learn and change themselves, our citizens shouldn't be overly burdened with expenses for attending a public education program.It's not that citizens shouldn't pay anything, but it shouldn't be so much as to keep them from working and meaningfully participating in the economy.

Deepthunkd,1.899999990564038,0.6419825475921161,1.2580174429719218,Positive,"Loan corporations, high interest what are you going on about?Ever since Obama loans have been issued directly by the government. There's a relatively small fee collected by Naveen or whoever the processor is but the federal government holds the loans directly. There are some private loans out there, but they're like less than 10% of the market I think.As for the interest rates based on the 10 year treasury, so the government basically linked its borrowing rate to the rate of the loan fixed from when the government had to finance the loan. Some of the loans are subsidized and technically run below the cost of the program and the appropriate level of default risk. Some of the loans make a marginal profit above this, but are more than offset by the subsidized loans so the program as a whole technically loses money for the federal government.If the loans were a 0% interest rate, I would've absolutely maxed them to 100% of whatever the government was stupid enough to give me, because a 10 year loan at 0% interest is basically 50% free money at a 10 year mark. It would incentivize colleges to not control costs properly and make the problem actually worse than the long haul. There's a lot of weird misconceptions about how student loans work and I don't really understand why people just feel the need to make up facts about them. One challenge with this is it would tilt colleges much more heavily into fighting for the students most likely to get good jobs, it is there is discrimination in the workforce against certain immutable characteristics, universities would start mirroring those discrimination points in who they would extend acceptance to. Hypothetically, if women were paid 20% less or people of a specific race paid 20% less to do the same job, it would be stupid to admit those people if it exposes the university to more default risk. As a country we attempt to use the university and scholarship systems surrounding it as a mechanism to improve class mobility and create equity. I'm not going to defend the system as good or bad, but this is a potential area where this type of would be very disruptive. A one hand, we want to hold schools accountable for producing useless degrees on the other hand we do not want schools only accepting people who are from rich backgrounds and of specific groups that historically would benefit from the discrimination Pedantically the most expensive universities (the big research schools) are using a lot of that money to do research and development which helps fund the future of American companies and keep our economy competitive in the world. The most expensive schools also will issue very large scholarships for people who are truly poor and qualify for peg grants, making the school virtually free , and for the smartest students, you can often find full scholarships if you are a national merit scholar or have extremely high scores at one of the second tier universities.If you're a marginal student academically trying to get into a school that's a bit beyond you, the lack of scholarships and financial aid is a Price signal telling you that you probably don't belong there. Also, if you're a upper half income family and mediocre student, there's a lot of places that will take you because well they'll take your money, and use it to subsidize either poorer or smarter students than you.If you wanna fix the system, the schools need to own the default risk. University is also need to just not accept marginal student students in programs that don't tend to have a good payback. The challenges, we are trying to use universities to amplify class mobility or offset other societal factors and trying to do that in such a way while shifting the cost around. The reality is through programs like MIT is open courseware you can technically audit any class you want (I used it to supplement my education a bit, and it was better than my professors). Learning and getting a high caliber education is actually more affordable than ever, the challenge is this universities are used as a signaling mechanism for the workforce to show that you are a person who can reliably do work when asked to show up on time follow directions, and not lye or cheat too much for many of the students. It's also a good place to help babysit people who lack the discipline to do self paced learning. With the state schools would do is probably adopt a two-tier system. Schools that rely on video lectures with incredibly high student to faculty ratios would be able to hit the Price targets, the tier one research institutions would just ignore the price target and lean harder into being places to access cutting edge research and make critical connections. It would probably result in a pretty hard sort to where there wouldn't be a lot of schools that want to exist in the donut gap in the middle. You're either getting a YouTube type university education, or you're getting much more hands-on and faculty access education Please stop lying. Federal undergrad loans will only cover 57K. That's no where nearly remotely near a mortgage.You buying a house for 70K?"
Leann004,1.9,0.6717311641927851,1.228268835807215,Positive,"Hi everyone,At the age of 57, and after more than 3 decades in repayment, I received the ""golden email"" on April 12th, and had to wait until May 3 ""to not opt out"". The student loans that I was tethered to for more than 30 years were completely forgiven on May 4th. Just wow!Here is what I did.STEP 1 - THE FORGIVENESSIn a state of euphoria, I posted a couple weeks ago when my loans were forgiven (see [ ). I explained how I wrote to the ombudsman which ultimately led to my loans being forgiven shortly after (the email address and full email are in that post).Once my loans were marked PAID at Mohela and StudentAid, I wasted no time (though I did stop to celebrate with a few lemon-drop martinis! :-) )STEP 2 - THE CREDIT AGENCIES (Optional!) This step is optional and is meant only for those who want to expedite the process. The credit agencies will automatically update your credit information on their own time, usually within 1-3 months. By taking the steps below (it took less than 15 minutes total), it took 3 days for my credit reports to show all of my student loans with a $0 balance.Once I got the letter showing all my loans were paid, I took a photo with my phone to save as a digital copy, then proceeded to dispute every student loan on my credit report with all three credit agencies since the balances and status are incorrect. Disputing records is FREE and can take up to 30 days. Do not pay to do this! Here are links to dispute - do it at the agencies (not CreditKarma) so you can upload your letter as proof. It will go much faster this way. (It took 3 days for me!)Equifax - [ - TransUnion - [ Experian - [ DAYS SINCE MY LOANS WERE FORGIVENWithin days of submitting the disputes, they were reviewed and the credit report updates started happening. I now have all the loans updated on my credit report to reflect the wonderful new $0 balance.* HOW THIS AFFECTED MY CREDIT REPORTEquifax dropped my score by 3 points after decreasing the balance to $0 and with the status of ""closed"". A huge factor in this is that my credit age is an average of all debt, which was cut by more than half. Meanwhile TransUnion dropped me 4 points when they adjusted all the balances to $0 but left them ""in good standing"" (not yet closed). I expect TransUnion will drop points again when it changes the loans to ""Closed"" because it will then adjust my credit age without those loans. That's fine by me! I'm not 100% sure, but I will update this when and if anything else occurs.STEP 3 - THE REFUNDOne thing that was nagging at me was the ""Effective Date"" that was listed as my loan forgiveness date. As I had been in repayment for more than three decades, an effective date of December 31, 2023 made no sense. This was an issue I repeatedly ran into with both Mohela and FSA because neither could tell me how many months they were counting toward repayment, and in fact seemed to have missing information about my payments. I only found it with my previous servicer, Aspire, which showed I was in repayment for 405 months - that's 105 months (8 years, 9 months) more than 25 years, which is the new cap for payment duration. Whatever repayment program you're in will determine if you have any overpayments. These overpayments should be refunded to you - but only if you can get the date corrected. If they don't correct the date, you will not get a refund.To get clarification, I called Mohela. They played dumb when I pointed out that some of my loans were in repayment since the early 90s, and then told me to call Federal Student Aid, which I did. However, the FSA phone system goes through a loop and eventually dumps the call without giving you an opportunity to talk to anyone at all. I came back here and noticed that others were experiencing the same issue with seriously inaccurate effective dates. The next piece of advice I found was to contact Consumer Affairs - [ . I heard that this is the fastest way to get them to correct this error and several people here have been giving that advice. I did file the complaint yesterday and not sure when I'll hear back.CAVEATPleae keep in mind that your experience might be different from mine. You may be in a PSSL program, which I was not. You may or may not have gone to grad school, and your loan term may be different - it's either 10, 20 or 25 years. I am offering my experience, including email address and actual email to the ombudsman as well as links to help anyone who is struggling to find this information. Best of luck to you!! To be honest, I'd rather drop my credit score than another payment for student loans! Yes, I agree, this was great info to learn. Thank you for clarifying this. I wasn't sure how it works together and I definitely didn't know they keep this info on your report for so long even after it is closed. That said, I want my report to reflect accurate information, and I want my student loans to reflect the actual date the loans should have been discharged. I'm 57 and more than anything, I'm in a rush to put this in the rearview mirror and move on with my life. They will, eventually, probably within a few months. However, I waited more than 30 years for this moment. I didn't want to wait another second longer. It's actually very, very easy to dispute information on your credit reports. You'll be done in 5 minutes. That satisfaction of seeing fast results was well worth the effort to me! I was so glad to see them going away. For me it wasn't real until it was real with the credit agenices! Hey, congratulations on your loans being forgiven! I'm so happy for you. Enjoy your life! Now that I can put it behind me, I plan on having a very happy life without all that student loan stress! Thank you so much! :-) There hasn't been a time in my adult life that I don't recall student loans weighing me down. It has been my entire adult life. I'm only 5 years away from the early retirement age of 62. Not that I'm in a position to retire, but I am certainly in a position to enjoy the money I work for (for a change!) and not feel enslaved to give it all to the government or people who think they're being ""cheated"" for not getting 3.5 times the amount back that I borrowed. Maybe now I can not feel so stressed about it anymore, which is an entirely new feeling for me. The goal is ALWAYS to pay it back as fast as possible. Had I had a decent (or even half-decent) job, I probably wouldn't have been in the student loan nightmare for so long. My ""crime"" was simply not finding a job after college to meet the payment amount that they were completely unwaivering about in 1991 - pay it or pay 8% compounded interest. They wanted 75% of my ridiculously low earnings - Had I paid that I would have been living under a bridge (seriously). I was dirt poor! It is so much better now because you can make partial payments and/or get a payment adjustment based on your wages - so if you lose a job, your payment would be decreased to $0 and then increase back up when you get a job. That's reasonable because the selling point to impressionable, highly trusting 18 year olds is this pie in the sky dream that you're going to make boatloads of money if you go to college and get a degree, while the reality does not always quite match that. Education needs to be affordable, and really the whole society benefits from having an educated work force. That big tax cut that corporations got in 2017 was shocking to me because had they left that in place, they could have covered ALL of the student loan debt. Think about it this way - if the students didn't benefit financially from being educated, who did? Those corporations who paid their educated work force next to nothing for the last 20 years, that's who! Thank you for your kind words! You can request a change in your payment amount based on your income. In some cases, you will not be required to pay anything at all. Definitely do not wait to take care of this!In addition to starting a small side business with the money I was using to pay my student loans (I now employ 2 people part time), I am going to relax a little and enjoy the fruits of my hard work. I'm going on a fun trip next year! :-) You don't have to dispute them. You're right, in most cases they will eventually be updated. This step is purely optional (I updated my original post to reflect this now, to avoid the confusion). I did it because I didn't want to wait. :-) At this point, I have not received a refund of any kind. To be eligible for a refund for payments that I made beyond the cap, the effective date for my loan discharge needs to be adjusted to reflect the time I actually became eligle, which was 8 years and 9 months ago. As for your situation, you need to compare the effective date of your loan discharge to your actual number of required payments (10, 20 or 25 years). If the date is not correct, work to get it adjusted. Once the effective date is updated, you should be refunded whatever you paid beyond that. Good luck with that! I'm sure you can use your canceled checks to provide proof of overpayments. Goog luck to you! No, they are still giving me the runaround. They replied with a bunch of nonsense about how they excluded certain periods and whatever. I responded that my loans should have been forgiven years ago, and I am entitled to a refund for the years I overpaid (obviously I didn't pay anything during Covid, so I'm not expecting a refund for money I didn't pay, but I am entitled to a refund of money I did pay). They told me to call them to discuss further. I called and then they said I had to call Student Aid. Student Aid directed me back to Mohela. And round we go. I just sent an email to the ombudsman again. I will not let up on this. I am entitled to a refund for the overpayments and I want my money. Student Loans can be a very good thing for a lot of people, but if you have any bumps in your career, especially when you're first getting started (which was my situation), they turn into predatory lenders very quickly, with a lifetime of struggles and misery. My loans should have been discharged 8 years and nine months ago. They need to change the discharge date and send a refund for the overpayments to make this right. I don't know what my next steps are going to be, but I will continue to document here for all to see. No word yet. I just filed a complaint this weekend through Consumer Affairs -[ - I'm hoping to see the changes and eventual refund in the near future. I expect I'll get a check, which is how I submitted my payments. I hate to give anyone access to my bank accounts when it's just as easy for me to set up a payment schedule using Bill Pay. Federal student loan borrowers won't pay income tax on any debt forgiven through Dec. 31, 2025. Some states (mostly red/Republican states) will apply a tax, but my state did not. Also, there's a chance they could renew that federal tax break, so keep your eye on the news. The link to that info is there in the original post. Log into your servicer account (if Mohela - it's [ ) and check there, then do the same at [ - I would not go to any other site to verify your email address. Be careful, some of this sounds like a scam! No federal taxes. Some states (most red states) will have state taxes, but as I don't live in a red state, I don't have to pay any taxes on the forgiveness amount at all. No, they have up to 60 days to respond, so probably some time in July. I'm hopeful! Fixed that, thank you! I paid back almost double what I borrowed before the forgiveness. What they forgave was 100% compounded interest, which was more than twice what I borrowed even after I paid back twice what I borrowed already. So don't worry, you weren't cheated by me, ever. I was cheated by a student aid program that made a lot of promises and renigged time after time, finding this loophole and that loophole to keep us paying them forever. I paid dearly with horrible credit when I couldn't afford to pay their inflated amount after I graduated (couldn't find a good job - I literally did not make enough to pay). It was much later in life that I finally started making a living at a job that didn't require a better credit score (because poor credit scores are just as bad as a felony when it comes to good paying jobs that require a college degree). Maybe you should learn the real facts of the situation and stop listening to news sources that have to pay $750,000,000 in damages for lying to their viewers. Then maybe you might be able to afford lemon drop martinis. Oh, and I pay taxes too. So I will go ahead and thank President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and I will pat myself on the back because I know this forgiveness was no sweat off your back and no thanks is due to such a cruel person as you. Yes indeed. :-) In that case, don't use that plan, you are not required to. I was in a similar situation, but I felt so confident that my loans would be forgiven so I went for it. Of course, I was shocked when I wasn't in the first wave last year, and I was in a near panic state for 10 months before they finally reviewed my account. That was SO stressful, I don't recommend it at all. Stay where you're at and keep your stress level down.I did have some grad loans, so my cap was 25 years. If you got a loan for even one semester of grad school, your cap goes to 25 years. If they're all undergrad, then you should write to the ombudman (see my original post for detailed info - [ ). Hang in there! I got the same intial canned email from the ombudsman, but they responded with a more personalized email about 2 weeks after I sent the email to them. I was shocked at the speed, because I still have a pending complaint at the studentaid site from last August, 2023! In that second response, they gave a relatively canned response, saying they'd keep an eye on my account and leave it open so they could follow through if necessary. I didn't expect anything to come of it, but it came very quickly after that. Let me know how it works out for you! I'm sorry, I didn't see this until now. I got the email at first (aka ""The Golden Email""), and then yes, I received a follow up letter via snail-mail confirming the details of my loans."
