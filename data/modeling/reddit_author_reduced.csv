-CJF-,"PPP loans were passed by legislation and designed to be forgiven if used properly, but [Trump removed the oversight]( which was shady at best.It's important to remember the field of law is a creation. It was made by people and has no inherit truth. What is legal and what is not is subjective in many cases. Student loan forgiveness is one such case. Roe v Wade is another. See the Dobbs decision and compare that to the prior Roe v. Wade ruling. They're inconsistent and incompatible because the justices hearing the case had different ideologies and personal beliefs. Forgiveness? Yes. I do still have some hope for the SAVE plan, just because overturning it would be such a wild stretch of the law. This bill is terrible and if they do manage to pass it via reconciliation Democrats would surely undo it via reconciliation as soon as they retake the majority. Where is the Protecting Taxpayers from Wealthy Business Bailouts Act?By the way, if Biden's actions surrounding student loan forgiveness were illegal, why does Congress need to pass a bill forbidding it...? It's not just student loans.Republicans are against so many safety net programs...SNAP and Medicaid, broadband and communication benefits, the Affordable Care Act protections for healthcare, etc. As bad as it was to give Trump the presidency I'm surprised voters would give republicans full control of government. They are going to make all of our lives more difficult.On the plus side,I think people will have massive buyers remorse by the midterms. Unfortunately a lot of damage can be done in two years with no checks or balances. At this point I just hope the IDR adjustment hits before the new administration takes charge, otherwise I will lose years of payment history. Then after SAVE falls I will go back to IBR. If Trump did it, it would be funny to watch it suddenly become lawful. But alas, doing this would require motivation to help people, which unfortunately just isn't there. It's a nice thought. I hope you're right. I'm still waiting on the one-time account adjustment to hit. What are they waiting for? If this drags on into Trump administration I have zero confidence we will ever see it. Regardless of how anyone feels about student loan forgiveness, we should all at least be able to agree that restarting IDR payment counts from zero is completely and totally unfair. Sounds like concepts of a plan with no implementation. I'm seeing a pattern on the right. For what it's worth, I'm about as pessimistic about republican policy as possible and I don't think IBR is getting changed. I wouldn't worry about that. Trump's plan to deport 20 million migrants via executive orders is estimated to cost upwards of a trillion dollars. It will be interesting to see if it faces any lawsuits and how SCOTUS responds to that with their *Major Questions Doctrine* or if we'll just see blind partisan hypocrisy. There is only one IBR plan (Income-Based Repayment). You are likely referring to IDR (Income-Driven Repayment) which is terminology that comprises all of the plans based on income such as PAYE, REPAYE, SAVE, IBR, etc. I agree with your assessment that a Trump Department of Education will not process any IDR forgiveness.Even in the worst case I think IBR will survive in some form. Republicans had proposed changes to IBR that remove the forgiveness at the end but add an interest subsidy. However, it would have to pass Congress. I don't think that will happen. The more likely scenario is IBR stays as is, SAVE (and possibly PAYE, REPAYE and portions of ICR) all go down with the lawsuit and no forgiveness at all gets processed under Trump.Just my 2c. This article is wrong that the lower interest rate wouldn't help people on income-driven plans. Those plans still accumulate interest at whatever rate you borrowed at, even if you have a $0 per month payment, so it would help.I think democrats would be on board with this if it's a clean bill with nothing else in it but I'm not sure how many Republicans would support it. More than likely, or it just won't have enough support from other Republicans and will flop. I hope I'm wrong. I agree with that and more, but with Republicans in charge we would be really lucky to get anything and 1% would definitely help a lot.",ppp loan passed legislation designed forgiven used properly trump removed oversight shady best important remember field law creation people inherit truth legal subjective case student loan forgiveness case roe wade dobbs decision compare prior roe wade ruling inconsistent incompatible justice hearing case different ideology personal belief forgiveness yes hope save plan just overturning wild stretch law terrible manage pas reconciliation democrat surely undo reconciliation soon retake majority protecting taxpayer wealthy business bailouts act way biden action surrounding student loan forgiveness illegal doe congress need pas forbidding just student loan republican safety net program snap medicaid broadband communication benefit affordable care act protection healthcare bad trump presidency surprised voter republican control government going make life difficult plus think people massive buyer remorse midterm unfortunately lot damage year check balance point just hope idr adjustment hit new administration take charge lose year payment history save fall ibr trump did funny watch suddenly lawful ala doing require motivation help people unfortunately just nice thought hope right waiting time account adjustment hit waiting drag trump administration zero confidence regardless feel student loan forgiveness able agree restarting idr payment count zero completely totally unfair sound like concept plan implementation seeing pattern right worth pessimistic republican policy possible think ibr getting changed worry trump plan deport million migrant executive order estimated cost upwards trillion dollar interesting face lawsuit scotus responds major question doctrine just blind partisan hypocrisy ibr plan income based repayment likely referring idr income driven repayment terminology comprises plan based income paye repaye save ibr agree assessment trump department education process idr forgiveness worst case think ibr survive form republican proposed change ibr remove forgiveness end add subsidy pas congress think happen likely scenario ibr stay save possibly paye repaye portion icr lawsuit forgiveness get processed trump just article wrong lower rate help people income driven plan plan accumulate rate borrowed month payment help think democrat board clean sure republican support likely just wo support republican flop hope wrong agree republican charge really lucky definitely help lot,333
42Pockets,"Absolutely! Education is the backbone of the First Amendment.Excellent!!! Keep it going!The purposes of Government set forth in [The U.S. Constitution: Preamble]( the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, *promote the general Welfare*, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.""These are the guidelines to decide should ""We the People"" do this?Alexander Hamilton even wrote in [Federalist Papers: 84]( about the importance of the Preamble.Here is a better recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our State bills of rightsOut of these purposes of government, Promote the General Welfare, Education for All is square in the sights of this idea. John Adams [wrote]( a bit about the importance of education in a democracy.the social science will never be much improved untill the People unanimously know and Consider themselvs as the fountain of Power and untill they Shall know how to manage it Wisely and honestly. reformation must begin with the Body of the People which can be done only, to affect, in their Educations. **the Whole People must take upon themselvs the Education of the Whole People and must be willing to bear the expences of it.** there should not be a district of one Mile Square without a school in it, *not founded by a Charitable individual but maintained at the expence of the People themselvs they must be taught to reverence themselvs instead of adoreing their servants their Generals Admirals Bishops and Statesmen**Here he makes clear the importance of the People being an integral part of the system. It gives us ownership of our own destiny together. He emphasizes the idea of the Whole People and Whole Education. This would include anything preschool and anything after high school, not necessarily just college, but also trade schools, etc.The rest of the letter John Adams wrote to John Jeb is absolutely fantastic. He goes on to discuss why it's important to create a system that makes people like Martin Luther King jr, Susan B Anthony, Carl Sagan, and Mr Rogers, and Washington. Good leaders should not be a product of the time, but of the educational system and culture of the people. If a country doesn't make good leaders then when that leader is gone there's no one to replace them and that culture and movement dies with them.Instead of Adoring a Washington, Mankind Should applaud the Nation which Educated him. If Thebes owes its Liberty and Glory to Epaminondas, She will loose both when he dies, and it would have been as well if She had never enjoyed a taste of either: but if the Knowledge the Principles the Virtues and Capacities of the Theban Nation produced an Epaminondas, her Liberties and Glory will remain when he is no more: and if an analogous system of Education is Established and Enjoyed by the Whole Nation, it will produce a succession of Epaminandas's.In another short work by John Adams, [Thoughts on Government]( [YouTube Reading]( he wrote about the importance of a liberal education for everyone, spared no expense.Laws for the liberal education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant.100 years ago we built in mass the first major wave of highschools in the United States.[In]( 1910 18% of 15- to 18-year-olds were enrolled in a high school; barely 9% of all American 18-year-olds graduated. By 1940, 73% of American youths were enrolled in high school and the median American youth had a high school diploma.This was a dramatic shift in education and economic gain for the United States. Not all of our grandparents went to highschool until the public saw it necessary to build them. The future is going to need more local experts than ever and a high school education that was good 100 years ago just isn't going to cut it on a global scale. People will need to change careers in the future and probably more than once. We will need continuing education as a society so that people can adapt and change with the coming times. This includes ensuring that after graduating high school people are able to attend and easily afford the education they need to participate in their community.As long as a person puts in their work to learn and change themselves, our citizens shouldn't be overly burdened with expenses for attending a public education program.It's not that citizens shouldn't pay anything, but it shouldn't be so much as to keep them from working and meaningfully participating in the economy.

AffectionatePause152,"""1% is too Socialist""- every Republican in office Student loans become due after graduation when most people make the least money they will make in their careers. As a result, people make minimum payments at the very beginning of their loan terms, and then they settle into a lifestyle where it becomes very difficult to increase their payments. Because most major corporations only give 3-4% raises per year, and due to the fact that the cost of living goes up 2-3% per year (or more), its not easy to allocate more cash toward paying off loans when someone gets a raise. This is a systemic issue that makes paying off large loans very challenging without a significantly large infusion of cash (marriage or a job change with a significant raise) or a significantly large reduction in lifestyle (moving in with parents or some other co-habitation).This causes the interest on the large balances to grow significantly, making the whole thing a rat race that is very hard to win in America. The solution is for taxes to provide free or low cost state education. It's not a pipe dream: this was the way it used to be in the 1960s. What we do instead now is force young students to self fund their education (federally, on interest) to enable older and current tax payers to pay a little less on their state taxes.I swear if Republicans could find a way to charge interest on Kindergarteners and bill them after high school, they would do it in a heartbeat if it saved them $100 a year. For every problem, there is a solution. Perhaps you can try to answer the questions yourself while being as creative as possible. That's one option. The underlying problem is that living costs are too high for college students. Loans just makes the problem worse because of interest. Perhaps the Feds can step in and instead of loans for every student (which have to be dished out again and again) just pay a single cost for a no-frills dorm building with very simple accommodations. Like 6 per room. But lots of shared space for actually working and studying (like libraries). Since costs are too high, there seems to be an imbalance somewhere where supply is not meeting demand and it's only being masked with the easy disbursement of loans. It's a very inefficient way of meeting the need when building actual structures to meet the needs would have a shared benefit that lasts longer. Food is food. We have lots of farms and subsidies going to farmers (big corporations) anyway. Perhaps we need to get the farmers to supply something for those subsidies they're getting. It's not fair. It doesn't have to be fair. We give all sorts of benefits to the military such as food, housing, etc. It's about meeting a national need at a reasonable cost, and that's it. We have to get this idea of fairness out of our minds. No tax or benefit on any group over any other has EVER been fair, but they are everywhere. It's only when we talk about helping students when all this hogwash about fairness creeps up. The point is that it's about priorities. We spend $40,000 on fuel per 3 hr training mission for our military pilots. How do I know? A pilot told me. Now, no one is saying that we don't need to train our pilots, but god damn that's a lot on money day after day. We surely have the means of creating shelter for student at a low cost. It's not that hard.",socialist republican office student loan graduation people make money make career result people make minimum payment beginning loan term settle lifestyle difficult increase payment major corporation raise year fact cost living go year easy allocate cash paying loan get raise systemic issue make paying large loan challenging significantly large infusion cash marriage job change significant raise significantly large reduction lifestyle moving parent habitation cause large balance grow significantly making thing rat race hard win america solution tax provide free low cost state education pipe dream way used instead force young student self fund education federally enable older current tax payer pay little state tax swear republican way charge kindergartener high school heartbeat saved year problem solution try answer question creative possible option underlying problem living cost high college student loan just make problem worse fed step instead loan student dished just pay single cost frill dorm building simple accommodation like room lot shared space actually working studying like library cost high imbalance supply meeting demand masked easy disbursement loan inefficient way meeting need building actual structure meet need shared benefit last longer food food lot farm subsidy going farmer big corporation need farmer supply subsidy getting fair doe fair sort benefit military food housing meeting national need reasonable cost idea fairness mind tax benefit group fair talk helping student hogwash fairness creep point priority spend fuel hr training mission military pilot know pilot told saying need train pilot god damn lot money day day surely mean creating shelter student low cost hard,252
Alternative-Rub-7445,"I finished graduate school in 2013. I've been paying monthly since the end of 2013. As of 12/24, I officially have qualified for PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness), and got my remaining student loan balance forgiven. I couldn't be happier. I thought this was all a legend and didn't know anyone who qualified yet, but I've met my agreement terms and gotten $185k+ gone from my life. I work in local government now, but to qualify you have to work in non-profit work I've been part of this program for an over a decade. I consolidated my loans in 2014 & applied for PSLF. I took out $274,266, paid around $500/month, still owed $185k including interest. I enjoyed my experience but now that I'm grown and wiser, I would've gone to schools that were cheaper though they really elevated my employment prospects They told me I have a couple of months overpayment as well Not zero interest. I think last I checked it was $130k principle & $40k + interest I owe Well, no, I would've paid more if I was required to, but I wasn't per the program. My job is fine. Thanks for the wellWishes Entitlement how? I never said I was entitled to anything. I just fulfilled a contractual agreement & the government kept good on their part of the contract they entered into with me Seems it all worked out just fine so no mistake here I have a Bachelors in Chemistry & a Masters in Public Health. I work in Public Health Admin Nope. I just fulfilled the terms of my contract. Provided my services, got something in return--over 10 yrs working toward it. I guess you can feel how you want about it but either way, I'm forgiven lol Hmm, kinda but finished on time. I started in undergrad as Psych, switched to bio, ended in chemistry--finished in 4 years with honors and busted my ass to do so. And my Masters was just 2 years My schools were private. I can't say they were my best decisions but they were decisions I made in my youth so I found programs to help me remedy. I was a student on a Pell grant--no money, my student loans had to pay for my books, room/board, health insurance and living expenses. I took out what I needed to live with the understanding that I had to pay it back. Yes! PSLF you have to be on an income based plan & have your loans consolidated to join the program & you certify your employment yearly. I really appreciate that. I just loss my grandma who raised me 2 weeks ago so I was reeling so getting this email was a great bright spot. Cheers to 2025 I did earn it. I appreciate the kind words. I recertified for the last time & went into administrative forbearance with MOHELA on 9/25, and got the official email 12/24 Definitely. No need to make more payments than necessary I qualified through the Public Service Loam Forgiveness Program Thanks! I'm so glad! It was a great email to receive for sure! The program didn't exist when I took my loans out and I was prepared to have to pay them back, but the program was offered and I took advantage of it. They needed me for something, I needed them for something. I certainly did not. I only learned about it after struggling to make my payments and I went to a financial planner in my city & she told me about PSLF. They don't even tell borrowers about it. I learned about it in desperation. They needed me to work a public service job making penny's with the promise of forgiveness instead of going corporate and making actual money. School tuition increases bc they can raise it, whether the few of us were getting ours forgiven after meeting our end of an agreement, or not. That's not my fault. I would've much rather not had to take out loans for college but alas I have a bachelors in Chem & a Master's in Public Health Mainly my Masters bc I had to take out loans for housing, though I did still work. I have a bachelors in Chemistry and a Masters in Public Health That's awful. I'm so sorry. They did make this process needlessly complicated I've been in the PSLF program for over 10yrs. I applied a long time ago & worked toward the payments Nope. PSLF is bipartisan What are you talking about? ""Can't pay?"" I signed a contract 10 years ago that if I made my payments & worked for 10 years then the remainder would be forgiven. That's all that happened. I fulfilled my obligation as set forth by the federal government who created this program to encourage college educated people to work in public service jobs. I also work my ass off, and I paid my car off myself :) Wasn't weird to mention. They edited their comment. It originally said their neighbor works at 6am everyday and busts their ass to pay their bills & their car off & didn't get their car loan forgiven.I said I also worked hard & I paid my car off myself The federal government wrote it off. They made an agreement with me & I fulfilled my end of it with 10 years of service & on time payments. I'm a girl but yes lol I got no pay outs & this isn't a mortgage. I am still required to pay that. You're not paying for it in the least. ??? The first folks to be able to qualify for forgiveness weren't until 2019 I think This is not under Biden. PSLF started under the Obama admin I went into forbearance with my servicer in October, & submitted my employment certification. Just got notified last week Idk. Mine were forgiven through PSLF. I've been going through this process for 10 years I don't control it? Thank you. I'm so confused here by many of the comments. People upset with me for qualifying for a program that the government started over a decade ago, lmfao. I paid what they told me to per their calculation. Doesn't matter now though. Congrats on paying your loans off! Thanks! No, I'm a person who got their federal student loan debt forgiven. I could see how my wording could be confusing Lmfao. Get over it. I didn't steal anything. I did agree to pay it, and then I agreed to work somewhere for 10 years while making payments & have the rest forgiven--my lender agreed. No lies here. I will soak it up. Thanks. You're welcome If you're in student loan debt with the federal government, you can work for a non-profit and pay for 10 years on an income based plan and they may forgive it. Else, you'll need to be a bank. Hope this helps What did you do for me? Surely not taxes because I also pay those. Again, you've done nothing for me. Anything you done for me isn't more than my tax contribution. Your taxes go to wars. You're welcome I can use my degree & training in the private sector & I likely will. I worked in the public sector because it was offered to me that if I used my skills there and helped, they would help me out--so I did. I paid. I just fulfilled my contract. I do feel special bc so many more people deserve this access but don't have it. I give back daily--it's kinda the premise of the forgiveness program Yes I was responsible for it. The government entered into a contract with me that if I worked where they needed me to & paid my loans for 10 years they would forgive what was left. I did so they did. Glad it all worked out for me. lol, what are you even talking about? Everything I did was legal Cry about it, I guess. This program has been around through 4 US presidents--started under Bush Jr. You are ill informed. PSLF was started to encourage skilled workers to work in public service jobs in exchange for loan forgiveness. You're welcome The program I completed existed long before Biden was elected No, he didn't. I'm not a Biden hater (nor lover), but Biden didn't do anything special for me is all I'm saying. I paid for 10 years, worked where they said I needed to and was forgiven per the contract I think it's pretty great & I'm grateful for it.",finished graduate school paying monthly end officially qualified pslf public service loan forgiveness got remaining student loan balance forgiven happier thought legend did know qualified met agreement term gotten gone life work local government qualify work non profit work program decade consolidated loan applied pslf took paid month owed including enjoyed experience grown wiser gone school cheaper really elevated employment prospect told couple month overpayment zero think checked principle owe paid required program job fine thanks wellwishes entitlement said entitled just fulfilled contractual agreement government kept good contract entered worked just fine mistake bachelor chemistry master public health work public health admin nope just fulfilled term contract provided service got return yr working guess feel want way forgiven lol hmm kinda finished time started undergrad psych switched bio ended chemistry finished year honor busted as master just year school private ca say best decision decision youth program help remedy student pell grant money student loan pay book room board health insurance living expense took needed live understanding pay yes pslf income based plan loan consolidated join program certify employment yearly really appreciate just loss grandma raised week ago reeling getting email great bright spot cheer did earn appreciate kind word recertified time went administrative forbearance mohela got official email definitely need make payment necessary qualified public service loam forgiveness program thanks glad great email receive sure program did exist took loan prepared pay program offered took advantage needed needed certainly did learned struggling make payment went financial planner city told pslf tell borrower learned desperation needed work public service job making penny promise forgiveness instead going corporate making actual money school tuition increase bc raise getting forgiven meeting end agreement fault loan college ala bachelor chem master public health mainly master bc loan housing did work bachelor chemistry master public health awful sorry did make process needlessly complicated pslf program applied long time ago worked payment nope pslf bipartisan talking ca pay signed contract year ago payment worked year remainder forgiven happened fulfilled obligation set forth federal government created program encourage college educated people work public service job work as paid car weird mention edited comment originally said neighbor work everyday bust as pay bill car did car loan forgiven said worked hard paid car federal government wrote agreement fulfilled end year service time payment girl yes lol got pay out mortgage required pay paying folk able qualify forgiveness think biden pslf started obama admin went forbearance servicer october submitted employment certification just got notified week idk forgiven pslf going process year control thank confused comment people upset qualifying program government started decade ago lmfao paid told calculation doe matter congrats paying loan thanks person got federal student loan debt forgiven wording confusing lmfao did steal did agree pay agreed work year making payment rest forgiven lender agreed lie soak thanks welcome student loan debt federal government work non profit pay year income based plan forgive need bank hope help did surely tax pay tax contribution tax war welcome use degree training private sector likely worked public sector offered used skill helped help did paid just fulfilled contract feel special bc people deserve access daily kinda premise forgiveness program yes responsible government entered contract worked needed paid loan year forgive left did did glad worked lol talking did legal guess program president started bush jr ill informed pslf started encourage skilled worker work public service job exchange loan forgiveness welcome program completed existed long biden elected did biden hater lover biden did special saying paid year worked said needed forgiven contract think pretty great grateful,595
Deepthunkd,"Loan corporations, high interest what are you going on about?Ever since Obama loans have been issued directly by the government. There's a relatively small fee collected by Naveen or whoever the processor is but the federal government holds the loans directly. There are some private loans out there, but they're like less than 10% of the market I think.As for the interest rates based on the 10 year treasury, so the government basically linked its borrowing rate to the rate of the loan fixed from when the government had to finance the loan. Some of the loans are subsidized and technically run below the cost of the program and the appropriate level of default risk. Some of the loans make a marginal profit above this, but are more than offset by the subsidized loans so the program as a whole technically loses money for the federal government.If the loans were a 0% interest rate, I would've absolutely maxed them to 100% of whatever the government was stupid enough to give me, because a 10 year loan at 0% interest is basically 50% free money at a 10 year mark. It would incentivize colleges to not control costs properly and make the problem actually worse than the long haul. There's a lot of weird misconceptions about how student loans work and I don't really understand why people just feel the need to make up facts about them. One challenge with this is it would tilt colleges much more heavily into fighting for the students most likely to get good jobs, it is there is discrimination in the workforce against certain immutable characteristics, universities would start mirroring those discrimination points in who they would extend acceptance to. Hypothetically, if women were paid 20% less or people of a specific race paid 20% less to do the same job, it would be stupid to admit those people if it exposes the university to more default risk. As a country we attempt to use the university and scholarship systems surrounding it as a mechanism to improve class mobility and create equity. I'm not going to defend the system as good or bad, but this is a potential area where this type of would be very disruptive. A one hand, we want to hold schools accountable for producing useless degrees on the other hand we do not want schools only accepting people who are from rich backgrounds and of specific groups that historically would benefit from the discrimination Pedantically the most expensive universities (the big research schools) are using a lot of that money to do research and development which helps fund the future of American companies and keep our economy competitive in the world. The most expensive schools also will issue very large scholarships for people who are truly poor and qualify for peg grants, making the school virtually free , and for the smartest students, you can often find full scholarships if you are a national merit scholar or have extremely high scores at one of the second tier universities.If you're a marginal student academically trying to get into a school that's a bit beyond you, the lack of scholarships and financial aid is a Price signal telling you that you probably don't belong there. Also, if you're a upper half income family and mediocre student, there's a lot of places that will take you because well they'll take your money, and use it to subsidize either poorer or smarter students than you.If you wanna fix the system, the schools need to own the default risk. University is also need to just not accept marginal student students in programs that don't tend to have a good payback. The challenges, we are trying to use universities to amplify class mobility or offset other societal factors and trying to do that in such a way while shifting the cost around. The reality is through programs like MIT is open courseware you can technically audit any class you want (I used it to supplement my education a bit, and it was better than my professors). Learning and getting a high caliber education is actually more affordable than ever, the challenge is this universities are used as a signaling mechanism for the workforce to show that you are a person who can reliably do work when asked to show up on time follow directions, and not lye or cheat too much for many of the students. It's also a good place to help babysit people who lack the discipline to do self paced learning. With the state schools would do is probably adopt a two-tier system. Schools that rely on video lectures with incredibly high student to faculty ratios would be able to hit the Price targets, the tier one research institutions would just ignore the price target and lean harder into being places to access cutting edge research and make critical connections. It would probably result in a pretty hard sort to where there wouldn't be a lot of schools that want to exist in the donut gap in the middle. You're either getting a YouTube type university education, or you're getting much more hands-on and faculty access education Please stop lying. Federal undergrad loans will only cover 57K.

Deutsche_Bank_AG,"Student loans are simple interest, whereas market returns are compounding. I have $300k in federal student loans at ~6% interest. Total payoff amount on a 30-year extended repayment plan is ~$512k. Instead of paying the student loans off, I invested $300k (the loan balance) in VOO in a taxable brokerage account. My bet (not really a bet, it's just math) was that the compounding market returns would outpace the simple interest. Have been right so far--current value of that taxable brokerage is ~$500k after about 6-7 years (i.e., almost equal to the total payoff amount on the loans). I expect that brokerage account to double a few more times while I continue to make regular payments on the loans. Best move I ever made. Student loans can be great leverage if you use them right. Yeah--I'm a lawyer too, though have been in biglaw so was easier to pile up the initial $300k. Some people are just so uncomfortable with debt, but if you follow the math it usually makes sense to pay off simple interest loans slowly and invest instead. The usual doomsday hypo people scared of debt offer up is ""what if you lose your job and stocks are down"". My response is: (i) you can easily get a hardship, etc., deferment or reduction in payments on federal loans in that situation so are pretty protected generally and (ii) worst case, you'd be selling stocks at a loss (maybe) to cover your loan payments until you get a new job--how long could that last even worst case? A couple years? And even in that situation, it's not like you'd be selling everything, you'd just be reverse DCA-ing out of the account until your cash flow returns and probably wouldn't be underwater forever on the stocks anyway. This all requires being comfortable with a little risk, but I don't think it's THAT much risk. Folks can be way too conservative with student loan debt in my opinion. ~$200k for me for a law degree (down from ~$260k initially--I paid off $60k aggressively before I settled on the strategy above) plus ~$100k for spouses MBA. They were gambles, but we don't come from any money so had nothing to lose really. Made a point to work to get into top schools so the odds of it paying off would be better. If you buy a share for $100, and over the next year the value goes up 10%, it's worth $110 at the end of the year. If the value goes up 10% again the next year, it's worth $121 (i.e., you get a return on previous returns).Simple interest doesn't compound like that. If you take a loan for $100 at 10% simple interest, you pay $10 each year the loan is outstanding (assuming no principal payments)--i.e., you don't pay interest on capitalized interest.The difference gets bigger the longer the periods. Take it out 30 years and, using the above two examples: (i) the one share would be worth $1,745, but (ii) the balance on the loan would be only $400. Yeah--some people are fine with ignoring the math and forgoing steep, relatively low-risk upside for ""peace of mind"". I'd rather have more money in the mid to long run and move up my FIRE timeline. To each their own. Generally yes, but you'd have to check your loan documents to confirm. A lot of the features and protections that come with federal student loans don't apply to private student loans, but they usually are still simple interest. 1. I mean, I also didn't have $300k to put in initially. I just kept saving and adding cash until I hit $300k cost basis--it took about 4 years, since I was following the normal order of operations before you get to filling up a taxable brokerage account (i.e., maxing HSA, pre-tax 401k, etc.). I think the math holds at any principal amount, unless it's so small that it's not with the trouble. I think $100k is probably enough to where it's worth the trouble. $25k? Would probably just pay it off. But that's arbitrary. If you're asking about what simple interest rate makes it stop making sense, I'm not sure. I think the highest federal student loan interest rate ever was 10.5%. Total repayment amount over 30 years at that rate on $100k would be $415k. Equity index returns on $100k at 7% over 30 years would compound to $761k. So a margin of $364k. And the 7% is the usual inflation-adjusted average return (whereas the student loans won't track up with inflation), so that's even probably too conservative.2. Nope. Depends on your HYSA but probably--I don't keep much in those, though, just my emergency fund. All other free cash goes into index funds.And yes--you just have to enroll in DRIP via your brokerage and they'll automatically reinvest dividends. Dividends are just part of the total return on the ETF. The return gap between simple interest debt and compounding market returns is huge over long periods. So yeah if you value whatever else you're considering more than that, then sure. Just taking my situation, assuming 7% average annual return on the $500k invested currently over the next ~20 years I'll be paying off the loans, that will be worth $1.9mm. The total payoff amount for the student loans will still have been $512k. That's $1.4mm in upside, and would require a really high present value on the ""some things"" you mention to make it make sense to forgo that.I generally try to avoid letting non-financial considerations impact my financial decisions.

EmergencyThing5,"The HEROES Act was around for almost 20 years by the time Biden tried to use it for student loan forgiveness. Before 2022, no one believed it allowed the President to forgive loans. The Congress that passed the ACT at the time believed there was really no cost to the HEROES Act because it effectively just deferred things until the crisis passed. It is absolutely fine to want a student loan relief program, but it was always ridiculous to say that the HEROES Act somehow allowed for it. Even with that, the Federal Government loses billions on these loans every year. That's exactly why it won't pass. This legislation would cost more than $50 billion a year, and it doesn't include a single thing that would raise revenue to both offset some of that cost and make it somewhat palatable to Republicans who would need to be on board to even get it to a vote before 2027. It doesn't have a single co-sponser either. Therefore, it has effectively no chance of ever coming to a vote. It's not a real bill. It's just an excuse to issue a press release. We need real efforts that have some hope of coming to fruition. This bill is a joke. I guarantee Lawler is putting no effort into getting it actually passed. No offense, but it's literally one guy. There are no co-sponsers, and this bill goes away entirely in a few weeks. There is no coordinated effort by Republicans on this. Introducing this bill just let that one guy issue a press release, nothing more. MOHELA has never publicly commented on the lawsuits, so no one knows their actual position. They have not publicly helped Missouri with the lawsuits though and they haven't filed a lawsuit themselves. Since none of the other servicers sued to stop it, I would assume they also wouldn't have sued if not for Missouri suing on their behalf. The Federal Government is their largest customer, so it seems reasonable that they wouldn't have sued them if it were up to them. However, MOHELA will likely never comment on it as they are effectively controlled by the State of Missouri who is the one pushing forward with the lawsuits. Assuming the information in OP's post is accurate and complete, there's almost no way all of this debt could be federal and eligible for forgiveness under PSLF. There's no way to get federal debt in the student's name that equates to $250k at age 26 for just a bachelor's degree due to loan limits. The majority of this debt either is a parent plus loan or private debt. If that is the case, OP's significant other is going to have a tough time dealing with this even if they get some of it forgiven. Undergraduates are generally limited to $31K in direct loans in total for their bachelors degree. Some borrowers can be considered independent and the limit increases to $58K, but that is pretty rare. That's the aggregate limit, not per year. Seeing as how student loan interest accrual was paused for like half the time OP's significant other had their loans, I wouldn't be surprised if more than $200K of their balance wasn't eligible for PSLF. Some of their outstanding debt probably is though, but it's a probably a small fraction. If the borrower incurred this debt for a grad degree, the whole situation can be very different. However, if this debt is just for undergrad, this is likely going to be a massive financial burden.",hero act year time biden tried use student loan forgiveness believed allowed president forgive loan congress passed act time believed really cost hero act effectively just deferred thing crisis passed absolutely fine want student loan relief program ridiculous say hero act allowed federal government loses billion loan year exactly wo pas legislation cost billion year doe include single thing raise revenue offset cost make somewhat palatable republican need board vote doe single sponser effectively chance coming vote real just excuse issue press release need real effort hope coming fruition joke guarantee lawler putting effort getting actually passed offense literally guy sponsers go away entirely week coordinated effort republican introducing just let guy issue press release mohela publicly commented lawsuit know actual position publicly helped missouri lawsuit filed lawsuit servicers sued stop assume sued missouri suing behalf federal government largest customer reasonable sued mohela likely comment effectively controlled state missouri pushing forward lawsuit assuming information op post accurate complete way debt federal eligible forgiveness pslf way federal debt student equates age just bachelor degree loan limit majority debt parent plus loan private debt case op significant going tough time dealing forgiven undergraduate generally limited direct loan total bachelor degree borrower considered independent limit increase pretty rare aggregate limit year seeing student loan accrual paused like half time op significant loan surprised balance eligible pslf outstanding debt probably probably small fraction borrower incurred debt grad degree situation different debt just undergrad likely going massive financial burden,244
Expensive-Annual1024,"During his first term, he proposed an income-driven repayment program for borrowers that would cap payments at 12.5 percent of income and discharge remaining balances after 15 years of repayments. He also signed an executive order forgiving the student debt owed by severely disabled veterans.And when he couldn't persuade Congress in August 2020 to extend the pandemic pause on student loan payments, Trump invoked executive action to extend the moratorium, setting the stage for the Biden administration to repeatedly extend the policy for another 2 1/2 years.From the article. The funny thing is, this entire board is all doom and gloom with Trump but these things mentioned aren't bad. Dude was trying to get the Covid Forbearance extended, Congress was the one that said no, so he had to do an executive action. And the 12.5% for 15 years is a pretty middle ground for all repayment plans. Just like the Rep sued Biden, the Dem states sued Trump. California is a very likely state that could go to bat over this: [ ""It's going to be insanely complicated,"" said Michael Brickman, who was a senior Education Department official during the first Trump administration. ""You really can't overstate the mess that this new administration is inheriting.""It could be VERY simple. Allow the one time account adjustment as that seems fair. All people NOT enrolled into SAVE reverts their pending apps to REPAYE. Allow people on SAVE to stay there for UP TO 1 year (cause some people haven't sent in income info in YEARS) and then start the recert process up. Those in SAVE will be moved back into REPAYE once they recert. Boom, fixed. As for the almost 40k apps for school discharge, make a case of how the school mislead you and everything. If you got a degree and it's helped, you shouldn't get discharged. Shoot, the army and all that is at all high schools with a much stronger marketing and getting you to sign (I know I almost did). That's some BS tactics there. REPAYE wasn't shitty. It will be interesting to see if it is brought back or not. That is the 50-50 question right now. As someone who said SAVE would be taken down back July 2023 and no one batted an eye, I don't see IBR going away. What I'm 50-50 on is if REPAYE comes back or not. That's the iffy part and where my head is. The poll, from the Associated Press and the University of Chicago, found that, overall, 39% of adults think it's extremely or very important for the U.S. government to provide student loan relief. More adults -- 51% -- say the government should relieve medical debt.Democrats (58%) were far more likely than Independents (44%) or Republicans (15%) to back student loan relief, which means, post-election and with Republicans ascendant in Washington, borrowers will need to get used to a new normal and new priorities. Which is something I always hammered on here. It is a SMALL size of people with student loan debt that needs help. It's not a HUGE issue in America compared to medical debt and the many other issues with our country. This hope for a ""dark Brandon"" is laughable. Out of the MANY issues out there, student loans isn't high on the list. I would think the trans issue is more higher at this point. And sorry to say, the common American isn't taking out lots of student loans. If they were, this would be a much higher topic for both parties to talk about. Neither mentioned much to do with student loans as they focused on many other issues. We are NOT a priority. While Betsy was TERRIBLE, the rules were very...let's say unclear to a lot of student loan borrowers. For PSLF, you needed direct loans (let's be honest, many people still had FFEL loans), did not make payments on time, consolidation started the clock all over, PSLF application had to be filled out 100% correct (even the date had to be exactly how it was laid out or it would be denied and yes, Fedloan denied MANY due to date being incorrect), correct repayment plan, lenders keep switching and losing loan history, etc. And this happened under Obama as well (yes, people didn't reach the 10 years under him, but people still could turn in applications that got denied left and right). Biden basically said all these rules are poo-poo and counted sooooo many things that should have never be counted under the IDR Adjustment (which is an amazing thing for people that honestly did not know) to try to fix the system. Again, not excusing Betsy at all as she should not have been in charge of education (she probably couldn't even manage a Walmart or McDonald's), but the system was broken way before her. Unless someone reminds him, he probably forgot all about SAVE lol. Of course he was going to protect his son before Trump could go after him.",term proposed income driven repayment program borrower cap payment percent income discharge remaining balance year repayment signed executive order forgiving student debt owed severely disabled veteran persuade congress august extend pandemic pause student loan payment trump invoked executive action extend moratorium setting stage biden administration repeatedly extend policy year article funny thing entire board doom gloom trump thing mentioned bad dude trying covid forbearance extended congress said executive action year pretty middle ground repayment plan just like rep sued biden dem state sued trump california likely state bat going insanely complicated said michael brickman senior education department official trump administration really ca overstate mess new administration inheriting simple allow time account adjustment fair people enrolled save reverts pending apps repaye allow people save stay year cause people sent income info year start recert process save moved repaye recert boom fixed apps school discharge make case school mislead got degree helped discharged shoot army high school stronger marketing getting sign know did b tactic repaye shitty interesting brought question right said save taken july batted eye ibr going away repaye come iffy head poll associated press university chicago overall adult think extremely important government provide student loan relief adult say government relieve medical debt democrat far likely independent republican student loan relief mean post election republican ascendant washington borrower need used new normal new priority hammered small size people student loan debt need help huge issue america compared medical debt issue country hope dark brandon laughable issue student loan high list think trans issue higher point sorry say common american taking lot student loan higher topic party talk mentioned student loan focused issue priority betsy terrible rule let say unclear lot student loan borrower pslf needed direct loan let honest people ffel loan did make payment time consolidation started clock pslf application filled correct date exactly laid denied yes fedloan denied date incorrect correct repayment plan lender switching losing loan history happened obama yes people did reach year people turn application got denied left right biden basically said rule poo poo counted sooooo thing counted idr adjustment amazing thing people honestly did know try fix excusing betsy charge education probably manage walmart mcdonald broken way unless reminds probably forgot save lol course going protect son trump,375
Flaky-Wing2205,"This should be done with several separate actions over a period of time. 1st step: No government money goes to private, for-profit schools. There are plenty of public schools that can use tax dollars better. My tax dollars shouldn't go to a bloated for profit system.2nd step: No government money goes to public schools for non educational purposes. Want to pay millions for new stadiums and coaches? Your sports programs need to be separately funding themselves. The same goes for extra student amenities. Funded independently of taxpayers dollars, students can opt into paying for access to ""special student lounges."" I would include dorms and basic meal plans in funding.3rd step: Increase funding to community and vocational colleges. 2 year degree is publicly funded. This covers a lot and for a whole lot cheaper. Get an associate degree free and then only pay extra for the bachelor degree. 2 years of college are publicly funded with no debt based on merit. These 3 steps would go a long way in building our country to be better and more globally competitive. They would also eliminate a lot of incentives driving up education costs. We keep going, though.4th step: Change new student loan payment structure. No loan payment, instead a taxed payback plan of 20 years based on income. After 20 years, there are no more education taxes. You make billions from your education, and you pay more. You make less as HVAC tech, and you pay less. Society pays for your education, and you pay society (future pupils) back (forward). There is a lot of nuance to work in this step.5th step: Loan forgiveness on existing debt. We two step this and have forgiveness start for old people. Anyone on social security or disability has debt forgiven. We continue to reduce the age requirement until we hit a point where only all legacy loans are eliminated, and only the new income based tax payments apply.6th step: Switching existing loans to an income based tax. This also happens over time at a rate more accelerated than the forgiveness program. This would decrease the existing burden on those not eligible for forgiveness yet. If an existing loan is better for high income individuals, they can keep the current loan.The end goal and outcome would be that anyone can get a two year degree publicly funded based on merit. Those who go to school longer don't have a debt per say. The higher incomes from more education would have extra taxes to pay back or pay it forward.P.S. For people who already paid off their debt. The above plan probably wouldn't have you missing out much. You put yourself in a great spot thru dedication and hard work. Enjoy buying a boat or vacation house later in life instead of paying for your children's education.

HyruleSmash855,"To be fair in this specific case, Biden has been focused on cutting through the red tape that is prevented people who worked in the public service from getting their loans forgiven, which is a perk of working with the government. He's not currently getting rid of any student loan debt at least with this plan that should have already been forgiven This is what he did, this should've already been forgiven since these people worked for the government:More than 1 million of these student loan borrowers received debt relief through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which promises loan forgiveness to public-sector workers - like teachers and nurses - after they've made 10 years of qualifying payments.The PSLF program has been in place for more than 15 years but had been riddled with administrative problems.""For too long, the government failed to live up to its commitments, and only 7,000 people had ever received forgiveness under Public Service Loan Forgiveness before Vice President (Kamala) Harris and I took office,"" Biden said in a statement.""We vowed to fix that,"" he added.Biden's Department of Education made it easier for borrowers to qualify for PSLF - a stark contrast to former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly proposed ending the program when he was in the White House.Thursday's announcement impacts about 60,000 borrowers who are now approved for approximately $4.5 billion in student debt relief under PSLF.

Idea-Technical,"I'd like to think I'm a fairly intelligent person, but for the life of me I can't figure this stuff out! I see many people celebrating their loans being forgiven, but mine haven't been so far. I've got about $20K in loans that I took out in 2016, 4 loans total. I was paying on them regularly, then during the pandemic my payments were paused, due to the SAVE program I think? It looks like they are due to resume payments in July, but the first year is 0 payments, so confusing! I've worked for a non profit hospital for over 10 years. I applied for the PSLF, but they said I haven't made enough qualifying payments. I also consolidated, but still haven't heard anything. I make less than the income threshold. How is everyone getting their loans forgiven? I had old student loans from years ago that I eventually paid off, but it was before the 20 years. Then I went back to school in 2016, graduated in 2018, so I assume 6 months after that. And then things were paused during the pandemic, and have been for 2 years. That's crazy that they defrauded you like that! Glad it got resolved! Imagine how many other people are in similar situation and don't know it. My state college charged me 36K for a 2 year online Bachelors degree. I never set foot on campus, except to walk across the stage! I would consider that fraud, or at least shady! It was a joke. Sarcasm lol... It was sarcasm lol. A joke about how crazy expensive it was.. I actually qualify for disability but I choose to continue working. I had spinal surgery after a serious accident, and my spinal cord was damaged during the surgery. I have partial paralysis in my toes, calves and pelvis, saddle paralysis causing a neurogenic bladder and bowel, and have a permanent urinary catheter. But I love my job and wanted to continue working, so I have PT/OT weekly, and was fitted with braces to help me walk better. It's a challenge but worth it to remain independent and keep working in a career I love. Based on my disability - and the recommendations of my neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon, and my PCP. And I don't just have a little PT, OT and some assistive aids. Trust me it's way more than that. I have to take breaks during the day to do bowel care because my bowel is paralyzed. I have to do catheter care and take all kinds of medicine just to get through the day. I am not looking for any type of sympathy, I'm just saying I couldn't stay home and not work, mentally that would be the thing that does me in. I enjoy being around people, caring for critically ill children, feeling like I can make a difference. Someday I will not be able to work, but until that day I will continue to fight the good fight. Yet the news leads everyone to believe that the loans are getting dropped off left and right. I understand that now, but all of the information I was reading was that people that haven't been paying on them long, or been working toward their pslf were getting them forgiven. I was even led to believe from some people I work with that they had theirs forgiven already, individuals that graduated the same time I did. I am by all definitions disabled, but I choose to make accommodations to continue working full-time.

Impressive-Peanut614,"I am a 100% disabled veteran, and after earning my bachelor's degree, I had my student loans forgiven under the Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge program. While this was a relief, it has created an unexpected challenge for me now.Because my federal student loans were forgiven, I am no longer eligible for federal student loans for graduate school. This means I would need to take out private loans, which often come with higher interest rates and less favorable terms.Additionally, I had hoped to qualify for the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, but my counselor informed me that I might not be eligible because I have several IT certifications and it might not be difficult for me to find a job. This program is designed for veterans who have significant barriers to employment.If anyone has found a workaround for this situation or has advice on how to qualify for the VR&E program despite having certifications, please share your insights. I really want to pursue graduate school, as most of my team members have master's degrees, and I feel it will be a disadvantage for me if I don't have one.Stay informed and make the best decision for your situation.NOTE: Currently work for the government GS11/12 Edit: After all the comments and suggestions, I called Nelnet and was informed that it is reversible. They will be sending me a one-page form to fill out and send back with a benefits letter. Thank you for taking the time to comment. Make sure to use all your benefits because you earned them! I left the private sector for the government. I don't wanna go back. Someone suggested UMGC 25% for federal employees. I'll try to get that No, I haven't been placed on PIP, I think I am doing very well in my team. I think it may be insecurity. All the GS9s coming to dept at least have a master's and almost everyone in my team. I am hoping that wouldn't put me at a disadvantage if I applied for GS13 come next year.Thank you, I will definitely look at the UMGC 25% of program. That's where I got my BSC from Thank you! This made me feel betterI came from the private sector and wouldn't wanna go back. I am way more experience than most of the Higher GS on my team, and I thought a master degree would be helpful to get there. That's what I am thinking. I wished I knew about the loan forgiveness fully understood I would have if I was still in the private sector. Took a pay cut to the fed, just to realize almost everyone i know got one. It's pretty doable with a lot of sacrifice. This was just a warning for others There are, but only if you go to State University. I will look into that, too. Thank you Yap. Waiting to get done with probation and start working on it I will be calling them before the end of the week I called them yesterday, and yes, it is reversalable. I'll definitely be doing that. Thank you! Call them. I was told it is possible, and I've applied for reversal. There's about a 120-day waiting period, and I am still waiting I think there's been a misunderstanding. My point isn't about complaining about student loan forgiveness. It's about understanding the long-term implications before taking advantage of such programs.For context, I didn't apply for the VR&E program; they reached out to me. After I responded, they informed me that I wouldn't qualify due to my certifications. If I had understood what VR&E does, I wouldn't have pursued it, even though they contacted me.It's crucial to be aware of how loan forgiveness and other programs might affect future educational opportunities, especially for those considering graduate school. They've student loan forgiveness or maybe TA. I'm on probation, and I'll pursue that once I am done Yes. You're correct, and that was the counselor argument 2 years ago I worked in IT and have the required certs to get jobs in that field with no plans to do anything. I understand why the counselor said I wouldn't qualify Why was that and how did you do it? Wow. Was it for a masters too. I am looking into 25% off for federal employees discount by UMGC and would certainly hope that happened. Thank you I have a lot of experience coming in. I just wanted to make sure getting to GS13 next year wouldn't be difficult. I am surprised with the number of people coming in at GS09 with masters degree Me too,but most of them have no experience. My manager had asked me to mentor some of them, and their concerns are not having enough real work experience. Maybe at some point they will have the experience. The fed need to do a better exposure for them Thank you for this comment! I am very doing great at my job per my manager. I was not hopeful that GS13 would be possible for me without a graduate. That is definitely insecurity on me I will take a chill pill and take it easy and be more grateful. HUAH!! I had to fill out the form because I thought I was done with school due to exhaustion from work and school. That was a big mistake.I don't think I will be able to reverse that decision Yes. It does. I don't know the whole process. I heard 10k student loan forgiveness, and I'm not sure whether that's yearly. I will look it up. Thank you! I'll probably call them for clarification on that.

Leann004,"Hi everyone,At the age of 57, and after more than 3 decades in repayment, I received the ""golden email"" on April 12th, and had to wait until May 3 ""to not opt out"". The student loans that I was tethered to for more than 30 years were completely forgiven on May 4th. Just wow!Here is what I did.STEP 1 - THE FORGIVENESSIn a state of euphoria, I posted a couple weeks ago when my loans were forgiven (see [ ). I explained how I wrote to the ombudsman which ultimately led to my loans being forgiven shortly after (the email address and full email are in that post).Once my loans were marked PAID at Mohela and StudentAid, I wasted no time (though I did stop to celebrate with a few lemon-drop martinis! :-) )STEP 2 - THE CREDIT AGENCIES (Optional!) This step is optional and is meant only for those who want to expedite the process. The credit agencies will automatically update your credit information on their own time, usually within 1-3 months. By taking the steps below (it took less than 15 minutes total), it took 3 days for my credit reports to show all of my student loans with a $0 balance.Once I got the letter showing all my loans were paid, I took a photo with my phone to save as a digital copy, then proceeded to dispute every student loan on my credit report with all three credit agencies since the balances and status are incorrect. Disputing records is FREE and can take up to 30 days. Do not pay to do this! Here are links to dispute - do it at the agencies (not CreditKarma) so you can upload your letter as proof. It will go much faster this way. (It took 3 days for me!)Equifax - [ - TransUnion - [ Experian - [ DAYS SINCE MY LOANS WERE FORGIVENWithin days of submitting the disputes, they were reviewed and the credit report updates started happening. I now have all the loans updated on my credit report to reflect the wonderful new $0 balance.* HOW THIS AFFECTED MY CREDIT REPORTEquifax dropped my score by 3 points after decreasing the balance to $0 and with the status of ""closed"". A huge factor in this is that my credit age is an average of all debt, which was cut by more than half. Meanwhile TransUnion dropped me 4 points when they adjusted all the balances to $0 but left them ""in good standing"" (not yet closed). I expect TransUnion will drop points again when it changes the loans to ""Closed"" because it will then adjust my credit age without those loans. That's fine by me! I'm not 100% sure, but I will update this when and if anything else occurs.STEP 3 - THE REFUNDOne thing that was nagging at me was the ""Effective Date"" that was listed as my loan forgiveness date. As I had been in repayment for more than three decades, an effective date of December 31, 2023 made no sense. This was an issue I repeatedly ran into with both Mohela and FSA because neither could tell me how many months they were counting toward repayment, and in fact seemed to have missing information about my payments. I only found it with my previous servicer, Aspire, which showed I was in repayment for 405 months - that's 105 months (8 years, 9 months) more than 25 years, which is the new cap for payment duration. Whatever repayment program you're in will determine if you have any overpayments. These overpayments should be refunded to you - but only if you can get the date corrected. If they don't correct the date, you will not get a refund.To get clarification, I called Mohela. They played dumb when I pointed out that some of my loans were in repayment since the early 90s, and then told me to call Federal Student Aid, which I did. However, the FSA phone system goes through a loop and eventually dumps the call without giving you an opportunity to talk to anyone at all. I came back here and noticed that others were experiencing the same issue with seriously inaccurate effective dates. The next piece of advice I found was to contact Consumer Affairs - [ . I heard that this is the fastest way to get them to correct this error and several people here have been giving that advice. I did file the complaint yesterday and not sure when I'll hear back.CAVEATPleae keep in mind that your experience might be different from mine. You may be in a PSSL program, which I was not. You may or may not have gone to grad school, and your loan term may be different - it's either 10, 20 or 25 years. I am offering my experience, including email address and actual email to the ombudsman as well as links to help anyone who is struggling to find this information. Best of luck to you!! To be honest, I'd rather drop my credit score than another payment for student loans! Yes, I agree, this was great info to learn. Thank you for clarifying this. I wasn't sure how it works together and I definitely didn't know they keep this info on your report for so long even after it is closed. That said, I want my report to reflect accurate information, and I want my student loans to reflect the actual date the loans should have been discharged. I'm 57 and more than anything, I'm in a rush to put this in the rearview mirror and move on with my life. They will, eventually, probably within a few months. However, I waited more than 30 years for this moment. I didn't want to wait another second longer. It's actually very, very easy to dispute information on your credit reports. You'll be done in 5 minutes. That satisfaction of seeing fast results was well worth the effort to me! I was so glad to see them going away. For me it wasn't real until it was real with the credit agenices! Hey, congratulations on your loans being forgiven! I'm so happy for you. Enjoy your life! Now that I can put it behind me, I plan on having a very happy life without all that student loan stress! Thank you so much! :-) There hasn't been a time in my adult life that I don't recall student loans weighing me down. It has been my entire adult life. I'm only 5 years away from the early retirement age of 62. Not that I'm in a position to retire, but I am certainly in a position to enjoy the money I work for (for a change!) and not feel enslaved to give it all to the government or people who think they're being ""cheated"" for not getting 3.5 times the amount back that I borrowed. Maybe now I can not feel so stressed about it anymore, which is an entirely new feeling for me. The goal is ALWAYS to pay it back as fast as possible. Had I had a decent (or even half-decent) job, I probably wouldn't have been in the student loan nightmare for so long. My ""crime"" was simply not finding a job after college to meet the payment amount that they were completely unwaivering about in 1991 - pay it or pay 8% compounded interest. They wanted 75% of my ridiculously low earnings - Had I paid that I would have been living under a bridge (seriously). I was dirt poor! It is so much better now because you can make partial payments and/or get a payment adjustment based on your wages - so if you lose a job, your payment would be decreased to $0 and then increase back up when you get a job. That's reasonable because the selling point to impressionable, highly trusting 18 year olds is this pie in the sky dream that you're going to make boatloads of money if you go to college and get a degree, while the reality does not always quite match that. Education needs to be affordable, and really the whole society benefits from having an educated work force. That big tax cut that corporations got in 2017 was shocking to me because had they left that in place, they could have covered ALL of the student loan debt. Think about it this way - if the students didn't benefit financially from being educated, who did? Those corporations who paid their educated work force next to nothing for the last 20 years, that's who! Thank you for your kind words! You can request a change in your payment amount based on your income. In some cases, you will not be required to pay anything at all. Definitely do not wait to take care of this!In addition to starting a small side business with the money I was using to pay my student loans (I now employ 2 people part time), I am going to relax a little and enjoy the fruits of my hard work. I'm going on a fun trip next year! :-) You don't have to dispute them. You're right, in most cases they will eventually be updated. This step is purely optional (I updated my original post to reflect this now, to avoid the confusion). I did it because I didn't want to wait. :-) At this point, I have not received a refund of any kind. To be eligible for a refund for payments that I made beyond the cap, the effective date for my loan discharge needs to be adjusted to reflect the time I actually became eligle, which was 8 years and 9 months ago. As for your situation, you need to compare the effective date of your loan discharge to your actual number of required payments (10, 20 or 25 years). If the date is not correct, work to get it adjusted. Once the effective date is updated, you should be refunded whatever you paid beyond that. Good luck with that! I'm sure you can use your canceled checks to provide proof of overpayments. Goog luck to you! No, they are still giving me the runaround. They replied with a bunch of nonsense about how they excluded certain periods and whatever. I responded that my loans should have been forgiven years ago, and I am entitled to a refund for the years I overpaid (obviously I didn't pay anything during Covid, so I'm not expecting a refund for money I didn't pay, but I am entitled to a refund of money I did pay). They told me to call them to discuss further. I called and then they said I had to call Student Aid. Student Aid directed me back to Mohela. And round we go. I just sent an email to the ombudsman again. I will not let up on this. I am entitled to a refund for the overpayments and I want my money. Student Loans can be a very good thing for a lot of people, but if you have any bumps in your career, especially when you're first getting started (which was my situation), they turn into predatory lenders very quickly, with a lifetime of struggles and misery. My loans should have been discharged 8 years and nine months ago. They need to change the discharge date and send a refund for the overpayments to make this right. I don't know what my next steps are going to be, but I will continue to document here for all to see. No word yet. I just filed a complaint this weekend through Consumer Affairs -[ - I'm hoping to see the changes and eventual refund in the near future. I expect I'll get a check, which is how I submitted my payments. I hate to give anyone access to my bank accounts when it's just as easy for me to set up a payment schedule using Bill Pay. Federal student loan borrowers won't pay income tax on any debt forgiven through Dec. 31, 2025. Some states (mostly red/Republican states) will apply a tax, but my state did not. Also, there's a chance they could renew that federal tax break, so keep your eye on the news. The link to that info is there in the original post. Log into your servicer account (if Mohela - it's [ ) and check there, then do the same at [ - I would not go to any other site to verify your email address. Be careful, some of this sounds like a scam! No federal taxes. Some states (most red states) will have state taxes, but as I don't live in a red state, I don't have to pay any taxes on the forgiveness amount at all. No, they have up to 60 days to respond, so probably some time in July. I'm hopeful! Fixed that, thank you! I paid back almost double what I borrowed before the forgiveness. What they forgave was 100% compounded interest, which was more than twice what I borrowed even after I paid back twice what I borrowed already. So don't worry, you weren't cheated by me, ever. I was cheated by a student aid program that made a lot of promises and renigged time after time, finding this loophole and that loophole to keep us paying them forever. I paid dearly with horrible credit when I couldn't afford to pay their inflated amount after I graduated (couldn't find a good job - I literally did not make enough to pay). It was much later in life that I finally started making a living at a job that didn't require a better credit score (because poor credit scores are just as bad as a felony when it comes to good paying jobs that require a college degree). Maybe you should learn the real facts of the situation and stop listening to news sources that have to pay $750,000,000 in damages for lying to their viewers. Then maybe you might be able to afford lemon drop martinis. Oh, and I pay taxes too. So I will go ahead and thank President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and I will pat myself on the back because I know this forgiveness was no sweat off your back and no thanks is due to such a cruel person as you. Yes indeed. :-) In that case, don't use that plan, you are not required to. I was in a similar situation, but I felt so confident that my loans would be forgiven so I went for it. Of course, I was shocked when I wasn't in the first wave last year, and I was in a near panic state for 10 months before they finally reviewed my account. That was SO stressful, I don't recommend it at all. Stay where you're at and keep your stress level down.I did have some grad loans, so my cap was 25 years. If you got a loan for even one semester of grad school, your cap goes to 25 years. If they're all undergrad, then you should write to the ombudman (see my original post for detailed info - [ ). Hang in there! I got the same intial canned email from the ombudsman, but they responded with a more personalized email about 2 weeks after I sent the email to them. I was shocked at the speed, because I still have a pending complaint at the studentaid site from last August, 2023! In that second response, they gave a relatively canned response, saying they'd keep an eye on my account and leave it open so they could follow through if necessary. I didn't expect anything to come of it, but it came very quickly after that. Let me know how it works out for you! I'm sorry, I didn't see this until now. I got the email at first (aka ""The Golden Email""), and then yes, I received a follow up letter via snail-mail confirming the details of my loans.",hi age decade repayment received golden email april

LeetleBugg,"The average cost of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $27,146 per year or $108,584 over 4 years.We could just call it what it is, price gouging. [source]( That used to be the case but not anymore. One undergraduate semester at my Alma mater, as an in state resident at a public state school, is now $16,062 for just the tuition and fees. That doesn't include housing, food, and other expenses. Most college programs are four years for an undergrad, meaning 8 semesters. That's $128,496 for an undergraduate degree, not including living expenses. There are grants and scholarships but you can't count on getting those as the competition is often fierce since most people are struggling to pay for this too and applying for every bit of available aid that you are. So yeah, an undergraduate degree from a public school easily ends up being 100k in debt if you get some scholarships, or have help from family, or work as much as you can to cover some cost. It's even more if you don't have those things. The best part is that most jobs require a bachelors. Even jobs that have no business requiring degrees. So yeah, young people's choices are limited these days. I literally went to my Alma Maters website and did a cost of attendance estimate today. So no, it's not 2022 data. And even if it was, nothing has gotten cheaper since then so idk what your point is regardless The average cost of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $27,146 per year or $108,584 over 4 years.[source]( is actually below the national average cost of a degree. Scholarships aren't given out like candy and everyone is applying for them. Part time work (if you can find a decent job) isn't going to be able to cover 30k a year. And many specialized ""marketable job skills"" programs actively discourage you from working part time. Living frugally is a bonkers statement in the current economy for middle and lower income earners.TLDR, you can't financial literacy your way out of this kind of price gouging, and suggesting people can, should, whatever is ignorant and blind to the current challenges young people are facing. So to make sure I understand you, your point is that college costs aren't exorbitant. And then you are listing sixish different things people have to do as workarounds to try and get past the exorbitant price tag on college tuitions. Also living on campus from my example is ""renting a room"", generally it's a shared room in a dorm. So you aren't cutting costs from that option there. Many people don't live within commuting distance to live at home and go to school. And if they do, then they will need transportation, so that costs money too. If you can find a part time job for $15/hr (good luck but let's play it out) and can average 15 hours a week every week for the entire year and never have to take any significant time off for finals and stuff, then you made a whopping $11,700 for the year. Not to mention, like I said, intense programs often discourage you from working so you can ""focus on your studies"". Hopefully you don't mind starving half the time and utter exhaustion from working and going to school full time at the same time!Associate's degrees are great, particularly for trade jobs, but increasingly, jobs want a bachelors. Even for jobs that shouldn't need one. It's stupid. So if you don't want to go into a trade the associates isn't a viable option for you.Community college is an option and one I advocate for with younger generations in our current educational climate, but you aren't guaranteed acceptance into a university after. So you might just be screwing yourself if you pay out for a community college and later you can't get into a university for the degree you are pursuing. Instead of blaming the people being shit on for not bringing an umbrella, we need to focus on the exploitation happening to our young people in the form of education. More and more jobs are requiring degrees, any degree. So people entering the work force are just screwed if they want to be successful at most careers. And we need people to be able to enter into all careers, not just the ones that have a lower education requirement. The cost of tuition in PUBLIC universities is exploitative. They need to be available and accessible to the public. It's literally what they are for. We have to stop gatekeeping higher education behind money. And we have to stop calling people doing their best to educate themselves ""stupid"" or ""gullible"". It's a damn diversion tactic to keep costs high while the plebeians fight each other. And you are falling right for it. Yes, students should have to live in a trailer to get an education..... That's an entirely rational and well reasoned expectation for our kids so they can ""earn"" their degree with out of the box thinking. /s ""The average cost of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $27,146 per year or $108,584 over 4 years""Every school is expensive. That's the problem. [source]( I'm not sure how to explain averages to you. Or the fact that your lived experience doesn't mean it's the same for everyone else. I'm glad you got enough aid to make it tolerable. That's really great. You only have 10k, that's awesome! That's doable! What's not awesome is saying that because it worked this way for you, it should for everyone else and if it doesn't it's their fault for not making it happen that way. Not everyone qualifies for the same federal aid, not everyone can work throughout, not everyone lives near a ""low cost"" school. Not every ""low cost"" school has the programs for the career you choose. That average I told you was for public universities. Not Ivy League or private, any of those factors that people shame others for ""choosing"" to go the more expensive, prestigious route. These schools are available for their public and should be accessible to their public and they aren't. That is the problem. By saying it's only as expensive as you choose to make it is ignoring the problem. I'm disappointed in you, but I'm hopeful that you'll eventually understand that just because not everyone has the same experience as you doesn't mean they deserve to be shit on. We all deserve better. And when people stop blaming the ones getting shit on for not bringing an umbrella, we can start fixing systemic issues and maybe make things like education better for future generations. It might be too late for us, but we can still advocate for others.",average cost attendance student living campus state public year institution year year just price gouging source used case anymore undergraduate semester alma mater state resident public state school just tuition fee doe include housing food expense college program year undergrad meaning semester undergraduate degree including living expense grant scholarship ca count getting competition fierce people struggling pay applying bit available aid yeah undergraduate degree public school easily end debt scholarship help family work cover cost thing best job require bachelor job business requiring degree yeah young people choice limited day literally went alma mater website did cost attendance estimate today data gotten cheaper idk point regardless average cost attendance student living campus state public year institution year year source actually national average cost degree scholarship given like candy applying time work decent job going able cover year specialized marketable job skill program actively discourage working time living frugally bonkers statement current economy middle lower income earner tldr ca financial literacy way kind price gouging suggesting people ignorant blind current challenge young people facing make sure understand point college cost exorbitant listing sixish different thing people workarounds try past exorbitant price tag college tuition living campus example renting room generally shared room dorm cutting cost option people live commuting distance live home school need transportation cost money time job hr good luck let play average hour week week entire year significant time final stuff whopping year mention like said intense program discourage working focus study hopefully mind starving half time utter exhaustion working going school time time associate degree great particularly trade job increasingly job want bachelor job need stupid want trade associate viable option community college option advocate younger generation current educational climate guaranteed acceptance university just screwing pay community college later ca university degree pursuing instead blaming people shit bringing umbrella need focus exploitation happening young people form education job requiring degree degree people entering work force just screwed want successful career need people able enter career just one lower education requirement cost tuition public university exploitative need available accessible public literally stop gatekeeping higher education money stop calling people doing best educate stupid gullible damn diversion tactic cost high plebeian fight falling right yes student live trailer education entirely rational reasoned expectation kid earn degree box thinking average cost attendance student living campus state public year institution year year school expensive problem source sure explain average fact lived experience doe mean glad got aid make tolerable really great awesome doable awesome saying worked way doe fault making happen way qualifies federal aid work life near low cost school low cost school program career choose average told public university ivy league private factor people shame choosing expensive prestigious route school available public accessible public problem saying expensive choose make ignoring problem disappointed hopeful eventually understand just experience doe mean deserve shit deserve better people stop blaming one getting shit bringing umbrella start fixing systemic issue maybe make thing like education better future generation late advocate,496
Logical_Holiday_2457,"How do you calculate five years of no interest? You mean the Covid positive plus the save pause now? Didn't people start repaying their loans in between the two? I paid on my loans that were under Navient all through Covid and all of them were accruing interest. OK now I understand what you meant by the five years. I was on IBR and had to pay my large loans during the ""pause "". I did not have to pay on my small loans that were owned by AIDVANTAGE. I have not had to pay during the SAVE pause, but my no interest is about to end because I will be on the borrower defense forbearance as soon as that paperwork goes through. Whatever it is what it is. Not for borrower defense. I just sent in my borrower defense application yesterday and my school is up there on the list of scam schools. I have a really strong case. Other than that, zero faith in any type of blanket loan forgiveness. I don't even know why they tried in the first place. It just made things worse for everyone. Now SAVE is likely going to be gone because they had to make it so extra with the added loan forgiveness. SAVE would have flown under the radar if that was not added onto it. I do believe we will get forgiveness, as our master promissory note states, after 20-25 years on an income driven repayment plan. You can Google it or join the borrower defense sub Reddit. What school? mine was Argosy university. They got shut down for defrauding the government out of student loan funds and had a retention rate of 17% after they took all of our student loan money with no degree. I earned 96 credit hours and did not get a degree from that program. I'm glad they're finally doing something about it 20 years later. If your school is on the list, do not sleep on this. Your application needs to get in before the next presidency I know I'm stuck with 243K. Check in see if the school is on there. You can likely find the list on the borrower defense sub, but if you had ""life factors"" that kept you from getting a degree, they're not going to forgive that. It needs to be in relation to something that the school did such as fraud or misrepresenting the program to get you to enroll. You might have a shot if they took away your degree program and did not allow your credits to transfer into a different program, even if your school is not on the list. Was that the case? Yeah you can't get loans forgiven unless there was fraud. How many years have you been paying under an income driven repayment plan? Dude I feel your frustration! I know it sucks for me because I had to consolidate in order to get on SAVE (make all my loans direct) so all of my interest got compounded for no reason because SAVE is likely going bye-bye. Meanwhile I've been enrolled in an income driven repayment plan this whole time because I was also told those are the only years that count towards repayment. I am worried that they're not going to count the time before consolidation, as they never did before this one time adjustment (your term ""look back"" is called ""the one time adjustment"" for future reference ) nonsense that has not happened yet. What a mess. At least you're on an income driven repayment plan and hopefully your payments won't be too much and eventually the one time adjustment will go through and everything will be fine. I'm trying to just enjoy not having to pay on them right now and take every bit of money I have and put it towards a down payment on a house. Hopefully the forbearance will not mess up my financing. Thank you for sharing your rational point of view. I agree with everything you said. None of our income driven repayment plans were taken away from 2016 to 2020. This doom and gloom will not get anyone anywhere. SAVE will hopefully stick around and the one time adjustment that was promised to us will hopefully still happen. If the cost of living was included in tuition, tuition would include the cost of living so therefore tuition would be way more expensive. Nothing is free. Who would pay for the tuition and cost of living? When I was in college, it cost the same for me to live in the dorms as it did to live off campus with a roommate. The food plan was more expensive in the dorms than it was if I went grocery shopping. I wouldn't do it until you need to.

Ok-Nefariousness-927,"To actually answer your question, student loans are more difficult to pay off for a list of interrelated reasons. First, the loans are structured differently, simple versus compound interest. Simple interest is based on the original principal, while compound interest includes accumulated interest. This first point sets the stage against the borrower of a student loan. I didn't think people really understand this one difference is the root cause for why student loans are so hard to pay off. When taken in context with the following 3 related points, you'll understand how compound interest loans are the start of the problem and every issue a borrower encounters is made worse from this type of loan structure. See example below. Second, loan terms for student loans are standard at 10 years versus 5-6 for auto making point one even harder to pay off. The longer term increases the total borrowing costs and multiplies the impact of student loan interest. Third, auto loans require principal and interest to be paid reducing the amount you owe over time. Student loans can be income based and allow you to make a payment less than what is accrued in interest each month. Again, coupled with point 1 and 2 compounding the problem of student loan payments being hard to pay off. Fourth, careers aren't straight lines and people are often dealing with the messy middle. People have gaps in employment, the economy, or you name it. New grads are entering a stage of life where they're balancing saving for retirement, starting to have kids, helping their parents, etc. All while making the lowest amount of their careers. As people experience wrinkles in their income, all three previous points compound the interest a person owes. The result is that all 4 of these issues work against borrowers in a student loan making it much harder to pay off a student loan than a car loan. Simple vs compound interest exampleFor a $30,000 loan, here's the breakdown of simple vs. compound interest:Simple Interest * Calculation: Interest is calculated solely on the original principal amount. * Example: If the annual interest rate is 5%, the yearly interest would always be $1,500 (5% of $30,000). * Total Cost: Lower overall cost compared to compound interest.Compound Interest * Calculation: Interest is calculated on both the principal and accumulated interest. * Example: If the annual interest rate is 5% compounded monthly, the interest in the first month would be calculated on the $30,000. In the second month, it would be calculated on the $30,000 plus the interest earned in the first month, and so on. * Total Cost: Higher overall cost due to the ""interest on interest"" effect.Let's illustrate with an example: * Loan Amount: $30,000 * Annual Interest Rate: 5% * Loan Term: 5 years * Simple Interest: * Total Interest Paid: $7,500 * Total Repayment: $37,500 * Compound Interest (monthly compounding): * Total Interest Paid: $8,500.76 * Total Repayment: $38,500.76Key Differences: * Calculation Method: Simple interest is based on the original principal, while compound interest includes accumulated interest. * Cost: Compound interest generally leads to higher total costs over time. * Common Usage: * Simple interest: Often used for short-term loans. * Compound interest: Common in credit cards, mortgages, and long-term investments.In Summary:While simple interest loans are generally cheaper upfront, compound interest loans can significantly increase the total cost, especially over longer periods. It's crucial to understand the implications of each type of interest before taking on any loan.",actually answer question student loan difficult pay list interrelated reason loan structured differently simple versus compound simple based original principal compound includes accumulated point set stage borrower student loan did think people really understand difference root cause student loan hard pay taken context following related point understand compound loan start problem issue borrower encounter worse type loan structure example second loan term student loan standard year versus auto making point harder pay longer term increase total borrowing cost multiplies impact student loan auto loan require principal paid reducing owe time student loan income based allow make payment accrued month coupled point compounding problem student loan payment hard pay fourth career straight line people dealing messy middle people gap employment economy new grad entering stage life balancing saving retirement starting kid helping parent making lowest career people experience wrinkle income previous point compound person owes result issue work borrower student loan making harder pay student loan car loan simple v compound examplefor loan breakdown simple v compound simple calculation calculated solely original principal example annual rate yearly total cost lower overall cost compared compound compound calculation calculated principal accumulated example annual rate compounded monthly month calculated second month calculated plus earned month total cost higher overall cost effect let illustrate example loan annual rate loan term year simple total paid total repayment compound monthly compounding total paid total repayment difference calculation method simple based original principal compound includes accumulated cost compound generally lead higher total cost time common usage simple used short term loan compound common credit card mortgage long term investment summary simple loan generally cheaper upfront compound loan significantly increase total cost especially longer period crucial understand implication type taking loan,282
OrangeTabbiesDad,"The courts so far have only touched in passing on the old ""horse left the barn"" issue. The district courts rulings were just as to preliminary injunctions on ""likely to succeed"" grounds, and the 8th so far has only issued language supporting the emergency motion pending appeal. Nothing has been concluded yet that has precedential value. If the 8th does now issue an actual ruling in the near future, that may change, though the matter is still only the scope of preliminary injunction. Also findings of law are limited to their own circuit, even if the injunction itself extends nationally. But whether the forgiveness horse truly left the barn remains to be seen, and possibly litigated, depending on just how draconian the new Department chooses to be, so I would take this particular guy's opinion with a grain of salt. Changes to the US Code by Congress, or to the CFR by the Department, or to either by a high court, will become the prevailing law for borrowers. That happened to my own loans, and the notes I signed became subject thereto, when the Department years later published rules extending IBR to FFEL. These things can go in the other direction too. How they craft laws and rules regarding the application of retroactivity, possible grandfathering, and claw-back if they really want to try that (maybe as an accounting correction, much as the IDR Adjustment was), is all up in the air now. I think the latter is a long shot, but not impossible. The cruelty is the point. Assuming the law will still mean anything next year, other than as window dressing, what the 8th does will not be the law of the land but only that of the 8th Circuit. Though granted any universal injunction has nationwide effect.As a reset, the appeals in the 8th and 10th Circuits just cover the scope of preliminary injunctions. The plaintiffs want the entire Final Rule enjoined, much as the 8th ordered for a couple weeks some months back (thus causing a glitch in the matrix). To my knowledge there were no motions for summary adjudication below other than partly as to dismissal, and thus no final judgment or permanent injunction regarding the Final Rule yet exists. But, the plaintiffs would also like the circuit opinions to contain interpretations of the law, even if just in dicta, endorsing their theory that Congress never intended forgiveness at the end of 1993-ICR-based repayment plans. I think that's crazy town, or at minimum protected by limitations periods, but here we are.Luckily we are not now before SCOTUS, where a holding regarding ICR-based forgiveness could indeed become the law of the land. Instead, it's possible we will see the parties move to put everything on long hold, possibly by stipulation, with the effect similar to what Jack Smith is now doing. Next year, these actions may ultimately be mooted by an incoming Department's published notice to withdraw the Final Rule and/or new proposed rules that amend the CFR more to their own ideology. How they go about ending these cases may matter in regards to timing and grandfathering. I surmise this is all being strategized right now by the transition team and packs of Heritage Foundation lawyers.However that settles out, instead of Missouri and CATO, the lawsuits then start flying from blue states, borrowers, and consumer organizations. The game begins anew, and eventually we end up at SCOTUS before Chief Justice Cannon (only partly kidding!)And because of all that, any ""what to do now"" advice is pretty difficult, as everything takes months to get set up even even beyond the current lawsuits, as does applying for plan changes. Though I certainly understand people not wanting to be in non-counting forbearance in times of uncertainty.We presume that IBR is more robust against meddling by the new administration, but of course that remains to be seen. If anything I might suggest everyone with Direct Loans review 20 USC 1098e(b)(7), particularly anyone who has been on IBR previously - because of (7)(A). IBR when it comes to FFEL and consolidation advice might be even harder to gauge due to how that was implemented back in like 2012, and may also be pending the fate of the Final Rule. Query too if the one-time adjustment counts conducted by this administration will even be honored? There will be much litigation to come. Edit: typo It depends what the 8th does. Yes any specific orders as to the Final Rule, if ultimately withdrawn or rewritten by new rulemaking, would be in effect only until superseded by those changes to the CFR, which will moot the underlying lawsuits. And any legal findings they promulgate (for example as discussed interpreting the intent and effect of the 1993 ICR statute), would only have to be followed by district courts in the 8th Circuit. Now, those findings might be persuasive authority in other circuits, but will not be binding. And with this 3-judge panel, I have a feeling many other circuits will not follow their reasoning, unless forced to by SCOTUS.I completely agree that student loan forgiveness generally, and many aspects of the more generous plans (zero dollar ""payments""!) are a tough sell, and that was true even before the center apparently red shifted on us. Small correction: Is it not *underwater* basket weaving that those freeloading Ivy Leaguers are spending our tax dollars on?You might be right about the blue states, I've been chewing on that. As a matter of fighting the Trump agenda, certainly a few state AG's will want to, but I'm uncertain as to the issue of standing. Maybe more likely to be individual borrower-plaintiffs, backed by student loan legal advocacy groups, and state AG's and liberal think tanks may just file amicus briefs. Venue may be better though, as to both district courts and circuits, and will probably be chosen carefully. In fact to look ahead at where we are going, it might be interesting to go back and see who may have sued DeVos and/or the servicers during the prior White House.The issues will be exactly the same albeit from a different angle of course: That the Trumpy Department of Education's rulemaking and actions misinterpret the law or exceed the authority granted by Congress. Thanks! It's way too complex to memorize, but I'm moderately experienced at reading briefs, judge's opinions, and looking things up. I've also saved a lot of these PDF's to a folder, and a great many lay out legal and procedural backgrounds, some of which go all the way back to the beginning with the 1965 HEA. You just have to get a sense of who is correctly laying out what has come before, and who is bending things with propaganda. Hint: mostly red state AG's and conservative think tanks. And the 8th Circuit! But the District Court rulings are pretty good in that respect even if the rulings partly went against the Department. I recommend them. Glad my ramblings are useful to some though! I got help here a year ago with consolidation, so once these lawsuits and injunctions landed I figured I could try to give back. Sort of a hobby that's similar to my day job. Depressingly true. A trifecta of control means the underlying law can be changed, eliminating pesky things like APA fights over authority and the courts blocking Department-created regulations (using newly-invented doctrines or otherwise). Also true that arcane student loan law, only occasionally making the headlines, may hurt quite a few and yet still be the least of our upcoming national tragedies. Some suits will still happen though, and I doubt they will be able to make the code fully bulletproof. Also likely to only be prospective, so grandfathering may end up critical. I don't know if everyone's Google search results are matching (blame the algorithm), but I just threw in ""lawsuits against betsy devos department of education"" and hoo boy, that's quite a list. Including by advocacy organizations and at least one state AG. I might try to look a few up at some point to see how they fared, but as DeVos apparently set records for being sued, categorizing them all would be exhausting. And while no prophet, I see much exhaustion on the horizon.",court far touched passing old horse left barn issue district court ruling just preliminary injunction likely succeed ground far issued language supporting emergency motion pending appeal concluded precedential value doe issue actual ruling near future change matter scope preliminary injunction finding law limited circuit injunction extends nationally forgiveness horse truly left barn remains seen possibly litigated depending just draconian new department chooses particular guy opinion grain salt change code congress cfr department high court prevailing law borrower happened loan note signed subject thereto department year later published rule extending ibr ffel thing direction craft law rule regarding application retroactivity possible grandfathering claw really want try maybe accounting correction idr adjustment air think long shot impossible cruelty point assuming law mean year window dressing doe law land circuit granted universal injunction nationwide effect reset appeal circuit just cover scope preliminary injunction plaintiff want entire final rule enjoined ordered couple week month causing glitch matrix knowledge motion summary adjudication partly dismissal final judgment permanent injunction regarding final rule exists plaintiff like circuit opinion contain interpretation law just dictum endorsing theory congress intended forgiveness end icr based repayment plan think crazy town minimum protected limitation period luckily scotus holding regarding icr based forgiveness law land instead possible party long hold possibly stipulation effect similar jack smith doing year action ultimately mooted incoming department published notice withdraw final rule new proposed rule amend cfr ideology ending case matter regard timing grandfathering surmise strategized right transition team pack heritage foundation lawyer settle instead missouri cato lawsuit start flying blue state borrower consumer organization game begin anew eventually end scotus chief justice cannon partly kidding advice pretty difficult take month set current lawsuit doe applying plan change certainly understand people wanting non counting forbearance time uncertainty presume ibr robust meddling new administration course remains seen suggest direct loan review usc particularly ibr previously ibr come ffel consolidation advice harder gauge implemented like pending fate final rule query time adjustment count conducted administration honored litigation come edit typo depends doe yes specific order final rule ultimately withdrawn rewritten new rulemaking effect superseded change cfr moot underlying lawsuit legal finding promulgate example discussed interpreting intent effect icr statute followed district court circuit finding persuasive authority circuit binding judge panel feeling circuit follow reasoning unless forced scotus completely agree student loan forgiveness generally aspect generous plan zero dollar payment tough sell true center apparently red shifted small correction underwater basket weaving freeloading ivy leaguers spending tax dollar right blue state chewing matter fighting trump agenda certainly state ag want uncertain issue standing maybe likely individual borrower plaintiff backed student loan legal advocacy group state ag liberal think tank just file amicus brief venue better district court circuit probably chosen carefully fact look ahead going interesting sued devos servicers prior white house issue exactly albeit different angle course trumpy department education rulemaking action misinterpret law exceed authority granted congress thanks way complex memorize moderately experienced reading brief judge opinion looking thing saved lot pdf folder great lay legal procedural background way beginning hea just sense correctly laying come bending thing propaganda hint red state ag conservative think tank circuit district court ruling pretty good respect ruling partly went department recommend glad ramblings useful got help year ago consolidation lawsuit injunction landed figured try sort hobby similar day job depressingly true trifecta control mean underlying law changed eliminating pesky thing like apa fight authority court blocking department created regulation using newly invented doctrine true arcane student loan law occasionally making headline hurt quite upcoming national tragedy suit happen doubt able make code fully bulletproof likely prospective grandfathering end critical know google search result matching blame algorithm just threw lawsuit betsy devos department education hoo boy quite list including advocacy organization state ag try look point fared devos apparently set record sued categorizing exhausting prophet exhaustion horizon,635
PandaKing6887,"Under the current system, we are already paying back our original balance and then some for 20 years. The folks that got lucky to get forgiveness so far are forgiven because they already been paying for +20 years including both the principal and interest. The problem was always the predatory interest that make the loan get ridiculous with +20 years of payments. The propose bill just make the 10 years amount including both principal and interest the amount that everyone owe essentially waving all interest above that amount with the caveat that we have to pay back the 10 year amount. The student loan was never a grant program, the forgiven amount was always taxable until the pandemic so we always owe debt whether it's to the depart of education or the IRS. Would you rather it be medical debt or credit card debt instead - Murica. People need to read the propose bill before jumping to conclusion. The propose that people will only pay back what they would have under the 10 year plan means that what's crippling folks with owing 2-4x more on what they've paid after 10-20 years is fix. The predatory interest accumulation is the big problem. Folks with low income would have never paid off their loans after 20 years anyway because they would just be shifted to the IRS to be indebt to them instead so added another what 10-20 years of being in debt. Not only that, when the loan get ""forgiven"" they count as income so those people lose access to programs like food stamps, housing assistance, medicaid ect. Why do expert not talk about this other things when talking about low income people? Do people want these folks to lose access to food stamps or medicaid? It's a different perspective, people under the current system would rather pay the tax bill after 20 years with forgiveness haven't crunch the numbers so not sure which is better although folks who can't pay the tax bill will have to be in debt to the IRS instead. Well assuming what's left after the court is IBR vs this new bill. It's question of do someone want IBR with forgiveness being tax income after 20 years with all the interest accumulation or the new bill with obligation just for the standard 10 years principle and interest only with the rest interest waived with the caveat of no forgiveness. It's basically the standard 10 year plan but with interest waiver built in to cap the total obligated payment to just the 10 year principal and interest. The hard part for a lot of folks to swallow is no forgiveness ever so it sounds dystopian being in debt to the government forever although the current system is like that with being indebt to the IRS with forgiveness but it apparent sounds more humane to instead of being in debt to the department of education forever, we get to swap from the department of education to the IRS. Assume that your obligation to pay each month is $100. You pay that amount but that amount only cover the interest and not the principal, under the propose bill after you pay $100, $50 would get apply to the principal so you are making progress however small. If you decide to pay $150, 100 would cover the interest and 50 would go toward principal and that's the end of that for that month. The cap on what you have to pay on the 10 year plan is retroactive, so if you can prove that you already did your obligations, than in theory you are done. The propose IDR is called the ""Repayment Assistance Plan"". No, the student loan component of the ED department would be transfer to the treasury department which conveniently also handle collection of taxes, which most people would be transfer to them after 20 years of forgiveness anyway since student loans forgiveness are tax. One way or another outside of public service loans, forgiveness is just being transfer to another government agency so that they can collect the debt.",current paying original balance year folk got lucky forgiveness far forgiven paying year including principal problem predatory make loan ridiculous year payment propose just make year including principal owe essentially waving caveat pay year student loan grant program forgiven taxable pandemic owe debt depart education irs medical debt credit card debt instead murica people need read propose jumping conclusion propose people pay year plan mean crippling folk owing paid year fix predatory accumulation big problem folk low income paid loan year just shifted irs indebt instead added year debt loan forgiven count income people lose access program like food stamp housing assistance medicaid ect expert talk thing talking low income people people want folk lose access food stamp medicaid different perspective people current pay tax year forgiveness crunch number sure better folk ca pay tax debt irs instead assuming left court ibr v new question want ibr forgiveness tax income year accumulation new obligation just standard year principle rest waived caveat forgiveness basically standard year plan waiver built cap total obligated payment just year principal hard lot folk swallow forgiveness sound dystopian debt government forever current like indebt irs forgiveness apparent sound humane instead debt department education forever swap department education irs assume obligation pay month pay cover principal propose pay apply principal making progress small decide pay cover principal end month cap pay year plan retroactive prove did obligation theory propose idr called repayment assistance plan student loan component ed department transfer treasury department conveniently handle collection tax people transfer year forgiveness student loan forgiveness tax way outside public service loan forgiveness just transfer government agency collect debt,269
Relevant-Platypus162,"I was expected to go to college, but deep down I made the decision to go for myself. I had a plan going into college: I wanted to become a High School English teacher. I got a lot of valuable experience: I was an RA in the dorms, I was a teaching assistant, I worked during two summer sessions on-campus for the housing department, visited local High Schools as part of field work experiences, and got some student teaching in. I went through a lot during undergrad. Especially as a first-generation student. I think my ""plan"" was established as a result of merely just passion, interest, inspiration, etc. I found teaching to be interesting and fulfilling work because of the amazing teachers I had in HS. I think I felt so pressured to go to college and trying to figuring what the f--- I was going to do with my life that, as a consequence, I didn't think really intentionally and deep about WHY I wanted to be a teacher in the first place. After student teaching, I learned over time that teaching wasn't meant for me. It was a hard decision to make, but I made it for myself. A lot of people in my family were frustrated and shocked about that decision, but I had to jump ship and find something else I truly felt was my calling. So, after spending a lot of time reflecting on my college experience, what I did, and what I did WELL, I noticed a re-occurring pattern in mentoring, coaching, and being a leader for my peers. Including folks like me who made the courageous move to go to university-the first in their families. Being a leader for college students (e.g. Resident Assistant in the halls) was something I grew through personally and professionally. I was a role model for many people, and many looked up to me. I learned how to be responsible for others' safety, belonging, and transition to college life. Cool stuff! I asked myself a question: how can I do this professionally? So, to put this question into action, I will be attending grad school in the fall to pursue my masters in student affairs. This will allow me to build upon meaningful experiences that helped me grow and others grow. College is a journey, and it's full of self-realization, personal growth, vulnerability, mistakes, and challenges. I am entering graduate school with genuine commitment, confidence, and intention--something I didn't do going into college. I did take out loans. Mostly, I took out small federal loans through financial aid. I had to take out a little extra for housing my freshman year. I received a lot of grants. The way I look at it: my degree DID lead me somewhere. As long as your degree enables you to access meaningful work that ensures you can give back to others in deep, meaningful ways, then you have won. That is how I look at the ""worth"" surrounding a college degree with loans taken out. I am looking forward to my next chapter. Your own journey may lead you to pursue something completely different after college, and that is OKAY. For a long time, I thought that after college we have to remain obligated to stick to something for the rest of our lives--even if it doesn't work out for us in the end. Whatever you do, be intentional about your goals. As long as you use your degree to pursue something meaningful, then taking out loans for it is worth it. Good luck, my friend! I hope this lengthy perspective helped.",expected college deep decision plan going college wanted high school english teacher got lot valuable experience ra dorm teaching assistant worked summer session campus housing department visited local high school field work experience got student teaching went lot undergrad especially generation student think plan established result merely just passion inspiration teaching interesting fulfilling work amazing teacher h think felt pressured college trying figuring going life consequence did think really intentionally deep wanted teacher place student teaching learned time teaching meant hard decision make lot people family frustrated shocked decision jump ship truly felt calling spending lot time reflecting college experience did did noticed occurring pattern mentoring coaching leader peer including folk like courageous university family leader college student resident assistant hall grew personally professionally role model people looked learned responsible safety belonging transition college life cool stuff asked question professionally question action attending grad school fall pursue master student affair allow build meaningful experience helped grow grow college journey self realization personal growth vulnerability mistake challenge entering graduate school genuine commitment confidence intention did going college did loan took small federal loan financial aid little extra housing freshman year received lot grant way look degree did lead long degree enables access meaningful work ensures deep meaningful way won look worth surrounding college degree loan taken looking forward chapter journey lead pursue completely different college okay long time thought college remain obligated stick rest life doe work end intentional goal long use degree pursue meaningful taking loan worth good luck friend hope lengthy perspective helped,254
SD-777,"Why does everyone downplay Biden's accomplishment here (FYI I'm no Biden super fan either). PSLF was willfully mismanaged for decades resulting in a near 99% rejection rate before Biden. Yes Biden is following the law, but who else has? This has been an inordinate amount of work for an underfunded Dept of Ed and Cardona is a Biden pick. Trump has already declared he is going to completely get rid of the Dept of Ed if he gets re-elected, let that sink in and think about what kind of oversight the lenders and servicers will have going forward. Sometimes just doing the minimum is heroic, certainly to those millions who put their faith in the government. Trust me, I know how ironic it is when we celebrate a president simply doing his job. I still believe he deserves the credit, again Cardona was his pick, he has also pushed forward student loan forgiveness outside of PSLF, in particular fighting against decades of willful mismanagement, forbearance steering, and forgiveness under disability, fraud, and even bankruptcy. He's taken the entire issue to SCOTUS, and is on schedule to see SCOTUS a 2nd time regarding his SAVE program. No, I don't believe he's ""just doing his job"" if you look at all the different ways he is actively attacking the issues over and above what is legislated, you can tell that he personally deeply believes in what he's doing, even though student loan forgiveness seems to be an unpopular political topic. Cue Betsy Devos version 2.0. So any legal minds have any idea what legal recourse there is to those who consolidated on the promise of forgiveness? Will we actually lose years of forgiveness and capitalize interest with zero recourse to sue the government?!? From what I understand, as a non-attorney, is that promissory estoppel is virtually impossible against the government. Which scenario is more likely?1) The dept of Ed actually gets out of Keystone Kops mode and updates the IDR counts. Biden forgives those in IBR before Jan 1st and fast tracks it through servicers to actually get done. (lol?)2) Those currently on SAVE are grandfathered into some sort of frankenstein SAVE plan, but slightly better than IBR. 3) Neither of the above happens (my money is on this) and we are just all screwed, especially the millions who consolidated on the advice of the dept of ed and Biden admin. We just lost years and years of forgiveness and capitalized lots and lots of interest for nothing. It's insane how ""fear-mongering"" quickly turned into reality. Best case scenario at this point is for the IDR adjustment to be finished by the end of the year and a switch back to IBR. My loans were up June 2024, right up to the wire, I will owe MORE taxes on forgiven loans than my original principal because of the consolidation (not even counting the payments I've already made the past 25 years) if they somehow don't get through before the tax moratorium ends. My question is WHY the heck are the IBR applications being held up?!?! There is a real chance for some to get forgiveness right away, but not if they are stuck in SAVE Yep, we all got called for fear mongering. Sure Congress via legislation could, they could also retroactively remove PSLF. Promissory estoppel would be extremely difficult to prove. But also, don't forget the 8th circuit did say any forgiveness up until the point of the injunctions was not to be touched, so that might be an extra hurdle. For me the concern is anyone who is either forgiven between the injunction and the new administration, and/or if they will honor the IDR adjustment (if by some miracle it actually gets finished) for those who are not yet forgiven (and subsequently if they will actually forgive anyone in the future). All I know is that the soon to be extinct Dept of Ed needs to get the forgiveness counts/IDR adjustment on the books, and Biden needs to forgive as many as possible under IBR. I'm sending in my IBR application today, but who knows if that will even be looked at before Jan1. This is assuming no one gets grandfathered into SAVE, honestly I can't see ANY of SAVE surviving. What a cluster @(#& This is what I'm most confused about, why exactly the forbearance doesn't count towards forgiveness. It's all tied up with IBR applications being blocked, I just don't understand how that's legal to continue to force borrowers in SAVE to stay there. I understand you can apply out and be in a 2 month processing forbearance, but after 2 months you will be back into a general forbearance which does not count towards forgiveness, so basically the same thing. Just open up the IBR applications, finish the god darn IDR adjustment, and at least get as many either forgiven, or have their counts adjusted, BEFORE the new admin takes effect. Well it's interesting that the 10th circuit ruled the opposite from the 8th circuit, I'm not really sure why the 8th's circuit ruling wins out here other than possibly because SCOTUS kicked it back to them. But at the end of the day it would all go back to SCOTUS to interpret the law. They probably stopped the IDR adjustment, although that's purely speculative. From what I understand the authority for that was via SAVE, which is mostly blocked now. That's why the dept of ed isn't forthright with borrowers about the IDR adjustment time frames, or rather the lack of time frames. He also coerced many to consolidate and lose forgiveness counts and capitalize interest. He let the dept of ed take almost 3 years to do the IDR adjustment and it's still not freaking done. I still believe he did a ton of good things, but some really dumb ones as well. Not a great article, they mention \*if\* SAVE gets approved... lol? They also mention a SCOTUS appeal, that ain't happening because the dept of ed under Trump isn't going to appeal, well I suppose unless the 8th circuit upholds SAVE, see above lol. So whatever the 8th circuit decides will likely be the law of the land. I don't disagree with staying with SAVE unless you need exactly 2 months for forgiveness. Switching to IBR you get into the 60 day forbearance which does count towards forgiveness, but after 60 days you go back into a general forbearance which does not count. Currently IBR applications aren't being processed other than that forbearance, which makes no sense at all because IBR is the only forgiveness which could be applied right now. This is a HUGE cluster exactly because the dept of ed has ZERO communication with borrowers. But would not the 8th circuit's ruling will be the law of the land because the new dept of ed will withdraw or rewrite the rules, possibly going through negotiated rule-making again, but certainly not appealing to SCOTUS? I understand there is more than the current injunctions, but with a trifecta GOP and the possibility of saying goodbye to the filibuster, well the GOP is probably going to ram through whatever legislation they want to augment the 8th circuit's decision. If you think ANY blue states or anyone else will care enough to file a lawsuit, well bridges seem to be in high demand for selling. Student debt is an unpopular issue to begin with, and I can count the number of times Harris mentioned student loans during her short campaign on zero fingers. On the other hand the GOP seems to have hit a nerve with their constituency which doesn't want to pay off ""Ivy League freeloading basket weaving majors"" student debt, that has been bought hook line and sinker. Even at best what would we see, some blue injunctions? Then a fast track to SCOTUS, then back to step 1. I just don't see the outrage, especially in regards to those borrowers who lost forgiveness counts and capitalized massive interest on the specific advice (coercion?) of the Biden admin. I do agree about the IDR adjustment, it won't surprise me in the least if it's thrown out and the recounts reversed. Just about the only possibility is that Biden forgives those on IBR, but the applications are closed so other than the 60 day processing forbearance that avenue seems completely closed off. Of course that's assuming the dept of ed actually finishes an almost 3 year old IDR adjustment, and finishes with enough time to force servicers to update. PS: Always appreciate the commentary, I wish more legal minds would comment on here. Small correction: Is it not *underwater* basket weaving that those freeloading Ivy Leaguers are spending our tax dollars on?Thanks for that I needed a laugh today. On blue states suing, I would think the harm to students would be pretty obvious, I would think the current dept of ed has a voluminous amount of financial research and how their plan massively helps student borrowers. The AG's standing would be their constituents, probably an easier hurdle than Missouri having standing because of Mohela. But again, just pipe dreams because I really doubt anyone is going to bring a suit, state or private. On the private side a class action lawsuit would be subject to promissory estoppel and the impossibility of that being used against the government. I do agree it would be great to look up any lawsuits during the first Trump term and see who the real ""friends"" of student borrowers are. At the end of the day Trump is going to rewrite the rules via legislation, and they will make sure and make it major questions doctrine friendly, aka bulletproof. It's just amazing to me how much in this country is going to massively change in the next 4 years. The one thing I'm most curious about is promissory estoppel. That the government can get away with what IMO is basically coercion to consolidate, capitalize accrued interest, and lose forgiveness counts, is just incredible. I'm far from an attorney, but the best read I've had was [this ]( discusses how difficult it would be to claim promissory estoppel if say the gov **retroactively** legislated PSLF away.Again let me reiterate just how surreal it is for the millions who consolidated on the dept of ed and Biden admin's ""promises,"" and I quote that because those ""promises"" sure as hell were not written in the promissory contract. I just cannot fathom that there is no recourse to this as far as I can tell, at least no one is talking about it.*In the event of a congressional repeal of the PSLF program, many of the plaintiff-borrowers' Tucker Act claims would be unlikely to survive as a basis to collect money damages. Any equitable estoppel claims would also likely fail. The borrowers, however, would have an alternative, political recourse. With the help of consumer advocacy groups, they should be able to lobby before Congress and the President to try and ensure that if an amendment or repeal does occur, it is done so in a way that--at the very least--protects the most vulnerable and at-risk members in various communities. Such an approach may have broader implications beyond PSLF.*",doe downplay biden accomplishment fyi biden super fan pslf willfully mismanaged decade resulting near rejection rate biden yes biden

TldrDev,"You can break 800 with just credit cards and pay no interest at all. This is bad advice. There are several factors that make up your credit score. Namely, your payment history, your card usage, your available credit, and credit age. There are other short term indicators like hard credit pulls that will negatively impact your score for awhile.Literally none of that has anything to do with interest or predicting your profitability. That doesn't even really make sense for the bank to do. What it shows the bank is the risk of the loan, which does trickle into the assumed profitability, but you paying interest really has nothing to do with this, nor do long term loans. Your credit score determines risk. On a chart, you can draw a line between the statistical likelihood this loan will fail vs interest rate and that will be the profitability of the loan. Your credit score is only a risk metric.To answer your question, what influances your credit are the factors I've laid out here. The way you can break 800 is by having a suitable number of accounts through various lenders, typically around 25ish open accounts. These can be credit cards, mortgages, car loans, student loans, etc.You want 10 years of history of good on-time payments, and you want about $60,000-$80,000 in available credit, of which, you use under 10%. You do not need to carry a balance month to month. You do not need a statement balance reported, just a valid payment.That takes awhile to do for most people. You need to steadily increase your available credit over time. If you do it too fast, you'll receive a lot of hard credit pulls on your account, which lenders will read as you nearing financial difficulty and offer you shit deals or even deny you.The way I did it was I got one really good cash back card for each sector of my life. I started with the Amazon card through chase, which gave me 5% cash back on amazon shit. I did this with Costco and an airline miles card, and various other stuff I regularly use.I basically run my entire life through those cards. I'll pay for everything I can wherever applicable to get the best deal. The day before the statement posts, I'll pay off the entire balance of the card. Once a year, I call and ask for a credit limit increase. Because I run my life through those cards, I get a significant amount of cash back every month, and the payment processor is happy to give me an increase. Literally everybody wins. I did that for a decade. 6 figure credit limit. Like maybe 2% reported usage, max. You'll break 800 without owning a house or paying a dollar in interest. 2k is an excellent start. Use the card every month, buy a few things on the card, and then immediately pay them off. It only took me a few years to start with a 2k secured card.After about a year or two with a secured card, they'll refund you your deposit and increase your credit limit to 4k. You should, around that period, be in the low mid 700s. Try to avoid carrying a significant balance. You want under 10% usage. That's the goal. If you have above a 10% usage you'll see a drop in your credit score, but if the next month, you pay off the entire balance prior to your statement posting, you'll see a large increase in your score.That's what you want to do right before you apply for your next card. Pay it all off, jack your score up as much as you can, apply for the best card you can (the Amazon Chase card is a really good card to start with here). Once you get to the mid 700s, apply for that card. Use that card for your day to day expenses, and then pay it off before the statement date. Keep the old card, always buying maybe a stick of gum once a month to keep the old card active, but use the better rewards card as much as you can, always paying it off every month.If you keep doing that, let's say for a few years, Chase will eventually increase your credit limit on the Amazon card to maybe 10k.Do this for a few years.Once you find a really good card that you like, the following card after doing this for awhile, you'll be approved and be given something like a 15k credit limit immediately on the new card. You'll start receiving offers on legitimately good cards at that point. Good airline miles. Decent cash back cards. Each time you get a new one you'll get a decent 5 figure credit limit on those cards. At that point you've played the game successfully, and you will eventually break 800, and you'll be maximizing all the rewards.It doesn't take long to go from 2k to 20k of available credit. A few years at most. Going from 20k to 100k at that point was opening 2 or 3 additional cards for shit you care about. Not all at once, over time finding a card you like and getting it.DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR BOOMER PARENTS ABOUT HAVING TO CARRY A BALANCE, YOU DO NOT NEED TO CARRY A BALANCE ON THE CARD. Just a valid payment needs to be made.",break just credit card pay bad advice factor make credit score payment history card usage available credit credit age short term indicator like hard credit pull negatively impact score awhile literally predicting profitability doe really make sense bank show bank risk loan doe trickle assumed profitability paying really long term loan credit score determines risk chart draw line statistical likelihood loan fail v rate profitability loan credit score risk metric answer question influances credit factor laid way break having suitable number account various lender typically open account credit card mortgage car loan student loan want year history good time payment want available credit use need carry balance month month need statement balance reported just valid payment take awhile people need steadily increase available credit time fast receive lot hard credit pull account lender read nearing financial difficulty offer shit deal deny way did got really good cash card sector life started amazon card chase gave cash amazon shit did costco airline mile card various stuff regularly use basically run entire life card pay applicable best deal day statement post pay entire balance card year ask credit limit increase run life card significant cash month payment processor happy increase literally everybody win did decade figure credit limit like maybe reported usage max break owning house paying dollar excellent start use card month buy thing card immediately pay took year start secured card year secured card refund deposit increase credit limit period low mid try avoid carrying significant balance want usage goal usage drop credit score month pay entire balance prior statement posting large increase score want right apply card pay jack score apply best card amazon chase card really good card start mid apply card use card day day expense pay statement date old card buying maybe stick gum month old card active use better reward card paying month doing let say year chase eventually increase credit limit amazon card maybe year really good card like following card doing awhile approved given like credit limit immediately new card start receiving offer legitimately good card point good airline mile decent cash card time new decent figure credit limit card point played game successfully eventually break maximizing reward doe long available credit year going point opening additional card shit care time finding card like getting listen boomer parent having carry balance need carry balance card just valid payment need,396
Ut_Prosim,"I don't see how a libertarian could argue against this in good faith.Wait -- of course, they could argue that this program should never have existed in the first place. They could also argue that it should be immediately phased out, and should not accept any new enrollees. But isn't ""contractarianism"" one of the pillars of the libertarian world view? I thought they were big on the idea that people should be bound by voluntary agreements made to reflect their personal interests (rather than being compelled by some external force)? Honoring voluntary contracts is the basis of all society. Once enrolled, the government and PSLF employees entered into such a contract. The employees promised to work in a specific field and region (as designated by the government) for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments under terms dictated by the government. If they did so, the government promised to discharge the remainder of their loans. The people in this story did just that, so they naturally expect the government to honor its side of the deal.Most of these folks made financial and life decisions based on this program. A lot of people took lower paying, crappier jobs, in areas where they didn't want to live, just to take advantage of this. They made a very detailed cost-benefit analyses comparing public service to industry, and this program is what tipped them towards the former. They sacrificed a lot, and took a large risk knowing that if the left a public service job before 10 years they'd lose 100% of their benefits, even if they worked for 99% of the term. The government also got a huge benefit, as it got to shift these professionals to regions and fields suffering shortages of workers.If these people had not enrolled, they could have refinanced with a private equity firm and gotten a lower APR. They could also have attacked their principal by making extra payments. In this program, the contract terms very explicitly required payments of 10-15% of income, no more, no less, all while the fixed interest (cannot be refinanced) accumulated. So if the government shafts them, they'll be far worse off than if the program had never existed in the first place.I don't see how you can call them freeloaders or entitled. If I promise a guy $50 to mow my yard and he does so, I can't then refuse to pay him and claim he's entitled for <surprised pikachu expecting a *handout* of $50. No, this is the case about SAVE. Biden introduced a friendlier repayment plan called SAVE that cuts monthly payments for a lot of people. The right challenged it for malicious reasons as expected, but the old plans under Obama and Trump weren't terrible. IIRC the original Bush era version required you to pay 15% of your income per month, and the Obama / Trump ones were down to 10%. The SAVE took undergrad loans down to 5%, and for grad loans allowed you to only count your own income instead of family income in the calculations (before, if you had a well paid spouse you were getting hosed as it took 10% of their income too). I think SAVE also had provisions where some [poor af] borrowers paid nothing. Public service loan forgiveness folks need to be in one of the income based repayment plans. If I understand correctly, this will force them to pick another (more expensive) plan, but it doesn't stop discharges when they reach their 10 years.",libertarian argue good faith wait course argue program existed place argue immediately phased accept new enrollee contractarianism pillar libertarian world view thought big idea people bound voluntary agreement reflect personal interest compelled external force honoring voluntary contract basis society enrolled government pslf employee entered contract employee promised work specific field region designated government year make monthly payment term dictated government did government promised discharge remainder loan people story did just naturally expect government honor deal folk financial life decision based program lot people took lower paying crappier job area did want live just advantage detailed cost benefit analysis comparing public service industry program tipped sacrificed lot took large risk knowing left public service job year lose benefit worked term government got huge benefit got shift professional region field suffering shortage worker people enrolled refinanced private equity firm gotten lower apr attacked principal making extra payment program contract term explicitly required payment income fixed refinanced accumulated government shaft far worse program existed place freeloader entitled promise guy mow yard doe ca refuse pay claim entitled surprised pikachu expecting handout case save biden introduced friendlier repayment plan called save cut monthly payment lot people right challenged malicious reason expected old plan obama trump terrible iirc original bush era version required pay income month obama trump one save took undergrad loan grad loan allowed count income instead family income calculation paid spouse getting hosed took income think save provision poor af borrower paid public service loan forgiveness folk need income based repayment plan understand correctly force pick expensive plan doe stop discharge reach year,261
arinehim,"I'm at 19K, I was literally done paying the loans off and got screwed over by the Republicans challenging the student loan forgiveness in court. Now it looks like when they implement it using the second method I won't be eligible for forgiveness. I'm really frustrated by it because my wife and I were looking at starting a family and this basically sets me back 2.5 years of grinding out payments. It was so frustrating because I was literally down to a principal balance of $500. I foolishly didn't park l that money into a High Yield Saving account to wait out the litigation. I don't have an exact number in front of me. I want to say it was around the 60k. I've been paying for years. If you exclude the pandemic and the pause I would have paid them off early. What frustrates me is there are thousands of REPUBLICANS in Congress who had their PPP loans whole sale forgiven. So they are all in favor of loan forgiveness, just not for a group other than themselves. I feel the same way. It's so funny to me they republican party complains that it can't get young people to vote for them. Maybe don't screw over millions of young working-class people. I actually gave props to Trump to pausing student loan payments and forgiving loans for veterans. If the rationale was good enough for Trump, why did Republicans suddenly have a change of heart when Biden used the same exact rationale? Sure it was political, that's the whole point of policy to do things your voters want. But if you take steps to strip a benefit away from a group of people whether it's Republicans or Democrats, dont come to me with crocodile tears when said group says they aren't going vote for Republicans again. I'm sure there a lot of folks on this subreddit who feel the same way I do.Bottom line, I would be debt free right now, starting a family without student loan debt, for others it might be purchasing a car, buying a house, maybe even starting their own business, but because of the REPUBLICANS I'm not, because I'm back in debt. Why do I blame Republicans? It's because if they had not brought the lawsuits I would literally be debt free right now. The individuals who encourage millennials to take out debt to get education were our parents and teachers who were both Republicans and Democrats. Bottom line is there's a direct line between a benefit my family would have received and that benefit being taken away and the political party that orchestrated it was the Republicans. They will never get my vote they rest of my life. Look I did pay them off, all the hard work you talked about, I did that. Used my bonuses, paid extra on them etc. I was literally down the last $500 of principal and I was eligable for the loan forgiveness. So I requested a refund on the funds I had paid during the pandemic (I continued paying never stopped). My mistake was not sticking the funds in a high yield checking account (my one and only mistake in this process). Then the forgiveness got struck down. Don't come at me with Bullshit about how I didn't pay, I did and I got screwed over by a political party hell bent on keeping young people down. Here here They took direct action that led to a negative impact for millions of Americans. This stuff isn't rocket science. If you hurt the pocketbooks/financial situation of a group of people don't expect them to vote for your party. Same thing happened with Abortion. You struck down Roe, which was a right women enjoyed for decades and now they find that right taken away from them (depending on where you live). Don't be shocked and surprised when they are motivated and vote against you. No I know that the Dems are not perfect angels. They are appalling in a number of ways I could easily list off for you. The bottom line is right now the republican action is having a direct negative impact to my families well-being/financial situation so they aren't getting my vote. Sorry from my perspective it's the Republicans fault full stop. There is literally nothing you can tell me to change my mind. I'm all for reforming the system but the republican policy on that front isn't any better.",literally paying loan got screwed republican challenging student loan forgiveness court look like implement using second method wo eligible forgiveness really frustrated wife looking starting family basically set year grinding payment frustrating literally principal balance foolishly did park money high yield saving account wait litigation exact number want say paying year exclude pandemic pause paid early frustrates thousand republican congress ppp loan sale forgiven favor loan forgiveness just group feel way funny republican party complains ca young people vote maybe screw million young working class people actually gave prop trump pausing student loan payment forgiving loan veteran rationale good trump did republican suddenly change heart biden used exact rationale sure political point policy thing voter want step strip benefit away group people republican democrat dont come crocodile tear said group say going vote republican sure lot folk subreddit feel way line debt free right starting family student loan debt purchasing car buying house maybe starting business republican debt blame republican brought lawsuit literally debt free right individual encourage millennials debt education parent teacher republican democrat line direct line benefit family received benefit taken away political party orchestrated republican vote rest life look did pay hard work talked did used bonus paid extra literally principal eligable loan forgiveness requested refund fund paid pandemic continued paying stopped mistake sticking fund high yield checking account mistake process forgiveness got struck come bullshit did pay did got screwed political party hell bent keeping young people took direct action led negative impact million american stuff rocket science hurt pocketbook financial situation group people expect vote party thing happened abortion struck roe right woman enjoyed decade right taken away depending live shocked surprised motivated vote know dems perfect angel appalling number way easily list line right republican action having direct negative impact family financial situation getting vote sorry perspective republican fault stop literally tell change mind reforming republican policy better,314
baby-luvs-gorgonzola,"I'm not sure whether to throw in the towel and hurl my (very small) life's savings at my balance, or to maintain patience and wait for potential forgiveness. Been paying my undergrad + grad loans since 1998. Hoped to qualify for forgiveness based on number of years in repayment, but no one on either the lender side or student aid dot gov side knows anything or has much info at all. The answer varies by the person I talk to, time of day, etcUPDATE DEC 2024: I made my periodic call to both student aid dot gov and my servicer (Nelnet) asking/begging for them to provide me my count of loan payments made since I started in 1999. Nelnet said that's student aid's job, and they are only one servicer I've had over the years, so they just don't have the number. Student aid said Nelnet should have that number for sure. I said they told me they don't have it. Their only advice was for me to ""file a complaint"" against Nelnet. I have negative, sub-zero % confidence that anyone knows that they are talking about at this point, or that I will ever procure this count, which I was originally told would be provided to me within 90 days (back in April). I feel your pain. I applied for the IDR plan in April 2024 in order to become eligible for student loan forgiveness based on number of years in repayment. And I've yet to be officially ""approved"" for IDR, even though signing up messed with my payments and I'm now paying several hundred more dollars per month under it. When I ask my lender or student aid dot gov when I'll be officially approved under the plan, and thus hopefully eligible for forgiveness, they have no idea. Yet I'm paying as if I have been approved for the plan. I'm sorry it happened to you too. I'm paying $400 more a month. The most frustrating part is that literally no one knows anything. I've been passed back and forth between studentaid and my lender and neither can even confirm how many qualifying payments I have. Or tell me when they'll know how many qualifying payments I have. Or really even tell me what exactly would make a payment ""qualifying"", because why not just count the months I've been in repayment??I feel as if I've (we've) been given a bait and switch. I am potentially qualified for forgiveness based on qualifying number of payments. However neither studentaid.gov nor my lender can provide further detail on if or when that may happen. They also cannot provide further info on the number of qualifying payments I have. Please share where you got this info. I've not been able to get any info out of either studentaid or my lender. As I understand it there is data on the positive impact student loan forgiveness would have on the economy. Hundreds of thousands of people in a financial chokehold would be freed up to buy homes, cars, etc., thus boosting the economy. A rising tide lifts all boats. In my case I'm not referring to blanket forgiveness but forgiveness based on months of qualifying payments. I signed up for IDR - which upped my monthly payment - under the pretense that the fact that I've been paying since 1998 would make me eligible for forgiveness. After I signed up and took that hit, no one knows anything. I applied for it in April 2024. The official status is still listed as ""under review"" on studentaid, however my monthly payment is higher, as if I've been approved. Previous to this I had consolidated undergrad and grad under a lender offer over a decade ago. I was told I needed to do IDR in order to qualify for loan forgiveness based on number of years in payment, so I did. Since May 2024. I was told signing up for IDR and switching my loans from consolidated back to govt would make me eligible for potential forgiveness based on years of repayment. I was told this by both studentaid and my lender. Did they lie?Also, while I've been signed up for IDR since April 2024 and paying on IDR since May 2024 my official status for IDR is still listed on my studentaid dashboard as ""pending review."" So your guess is as good as mine. It's a cluster. I'm not even sure they had income-based plans back in the 90s. Well then I was lied to. Or my enrollment in IDR was necessitated by re-enrolling in a federal plan after having consolidated with a lender decades ago. In either scenario I was most definitely told I needed to enroll in an IDR plan in order to be eligible for the look-back and further consideration for forgiveness based on time in repayment.In any case, maybe none of that matters since literally no one I've talked to at either studentgov or my lender is able to tell me 1) how many qualifying payments I have, 2) when my case might be looked at and/or evaluated for forgiveness based on my number of qualifying payments, 3) anything - they know nothing and the story changes each time I call.I am going on 7 months of calling and asking these same questions, after doing what they asked of me (flipping my loans back to fed + enrolling in an IDR plan). I feel like I've been taken for a ride, since my payments are now $400 more per month. Thank you! I hope it works out for everyone. The money I'm referring to is my emergency fund and some other basic savings. And that would cover about 30%. Save for a 401 and IRA, that's all I have. I find it helps to have empathy. People have extenuating circumstances - health issues, generational poverty, and layoffs to name but a few. Also these are not normal loans, they've been proven to be predatory and we essentially sign our financial future away when we are 18 or 19 years old and our frontal lobe isn't even fully developed, in order to try and get an education and contribute to society.Like I always say, if they had pulled this type of predatory and unethical shit with boomers' mortgages we'd have seen them rioting in the streets. I signed up for IDR based on the pretense that I would be eligible for forgiveness based on # of months of qualifying payments. Now no one can provide me with further details on that. Same. Did undergrad from 1994-1998. Been paying student loans since late 1998. Forgiveness based on # of months in repayment / # of qualifying payments (in my case). Wondered if others were feeling equally hopeless about their cases. But the govt regularly takes on huge debts in furtherance of economic growth - PPP loans, industry bailouts, etc Unfortunately I have never been eligible for this I adjusted my payment plan, increased my payments, and signed my name to this, on a false premise. I think there is a word for this. The student loan industry has been rampant with fraud, misinformation, miscalculations, miscommunication, and outright lies. If this were happening in the mortgage industry people like you would be storming the Capitol.Also, I'm sorry it so deeply triggers you that some people want to follow their dream of becoming teachers, doctors, engineers, social workers and other things that society could easily do without.",sure throw towel hurl small life saving balance maintain patience wait potential forgiveness paying undergrad grad loan hoped qualify forgiveness based number year repayment lender student aid dot gov know info answer varies person talk time day etcupdate dec periodic student aid dot gov servicer nelnet asking begging provide count loan payment started nelnet said student aid job servicer year just number student aid said nelnet number sure said told advice file complaint nelnet negative sub zero confidence know talking point procure count originally told provided day april feel pain applied idr plan april order eligible student loan forgiveness based number year repayment officially approved idr signing messed payment paying dollar month ask lender student aid dot gov officially approved plan hopefully eligible forgiveness idea paying approved plan sorry happened paying month frustrating literally know passed forth studentaid lender confirm qualifying payment tell know qualifying payment really tell exactly make payment qualifying just count month repayment feel given bait switch potentially qualified forgiveness based qualifying number payment studentaid gov lender provide happen provide info number qualifying payment share got info able info studentaid lender understand data positive impact student loan forgiveness economy hundred thousand people financial chokehold freed buy home car boosting economy rising tide lift boat case referring blanket forgiveness forgiveness based month qualifying payment signed idr upped monthly payment pretense fact paying make eligible forgiveness signed took hit know applied april official status listed review studentaid monthly payment higher approved previous consolidated undergrad grad lender offer decade ago told needed idr order qualify loan forgiveness based number year payment did told signing idr switching loan consolidated govt make eligible potential forgiveness based year repayment told studentaid lender did lie signed idr april paying idr official status idr listed studentaid dashboard pending review guess good cluster sure income based plan lied enrollment idr necessitated enrolling federal plan having consolidated lender decade ago scenario definitely told needed enroll idr plan order eligible look consideration forgiveness based time repayment case maybe matter literally talked studentgov lender able tell qualifying payment case looked evaluated forgiveness based number qualifying payment know story change time going month calling asking question doing asked flipping loan fed enrolling idr plan feel like taken ride payment month thank hope work money referring emergency fund basic saving cover save ira help empathy people extenuating circumstance health issue generational poverty layoff normal loan proven predatory essentially sign financial future away year old frontal lobe fully developed order try education contribute society like say pulled type predatory unethical shit boomer mortgage seen rioting street signed idr based pretense eligible forgiveness based month qualifying payment provide detail did undergrad paying student loan late forgiveness based month repayment qualifying payment case wondered feeling equally hopeless case govt regularly take huge debt furtherance economic growth ppp loan industry bailouts unfortunately eligible adjusted payment plan increased payment signed false premise think word student loan industry rampant fraud misinformation miscalculation miscommunication outright lie happening mortgage industry people like storming capitol sorry deeply trigger people want follow dream teacher doctor engineer social worker thing society easily,510
blueskyandsea,"A republican will never get my vote again, ever. Finally, there was something that could help prevent the ballooning balances and they had to go and sue because can't have average Americans benefiting from anything. States could start funding them better. There may be some aspects colleges could cut down on, but the majority of the reason for tuition increases is the slashing of state funding. They've been slashing funding since the 80s. Republican messaging pretends it's just game rooms and football fields, but in most cases, it's cuts to state funding so students have to bear more of tuition. Even if it were to pass, it would apply to new borrowers. Getting rid of all plans that most of us signed up with would be suicide in the midterms. If we speak up and demand to be heard, I had interest capitalized and high interest b/c mine are largely graduate is three times my mortgage and impossible to ever because of a struggle while getting started, and then during my primary earning years, I was hit with a serious health issue that made it impossible to do my job leading to a ballooning balance, many elderly are stuck with ballooned balances, even having their Social Security check partially garnished.Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't put anything past Republicans, but if we start advocating along with economists who understand that this is harmful to the overall economy our voices could be heard. Every single person with a student loan needs to be writing their representatives. I understand the feeling, but the best thing we can do is speak up, at least start sending letters to representatives and Joining in with some of the advocacy groups. This! Hundred percent this, we can't just complain about it here. Every single person should be writing their representatives and asking what they can do to help advocacy groups. Average people don't matter to Rs at all. The Ds also do a lot for the wealthiest, why but they at least do some things for average American, whereas Rs use their propaganda machine to vilify any program that is not geared towards the wealthy and corporations. I That would make sense, but it would benefit average people and that's not allowed, and the billionaires need their private loans so never gonna happen. That will have minimal impact without increases in state funding, the main reason for the ever rising tuition. They've been cutting it since Reagan. There is administrative bloat, but a lot of of that is needed to maintain regional accreditation and be eligible to offer financial aid. It's also just not gonna make that much of a difference at the vast majority of colleges. I know this is old, but I understand. I'll hit 25 years in 2026 when the tax bomb is set to come back. I feel like I can't catch a break and it's so depressing. My loan ballooned due to an accident I could never have foreseen. I'm so tired of the self-righteous ""youdidn't read your paperwork close enough, we paid our loans you pay yours"" hateful people. It's just so unfair. I hate Republicans so much! My hatred of Rs for doing this has created some dark revenge fantasies. Every single Republican could die tomorrow and I would celebrate.

burner12077,"The reality is that 100k is sort of on the high end if you use all the resources out there. But not everyone knows this. If you use every single form of financial aid and apply for every scholarship possible, and also take care to be frugal and work part time while schooling (which actually statistically increases your chances of success) then most people who aren't in an ivy league school should graduate with a much smaller student loan. I know a lot of people who managed like 20-50k. I know a few who did this and got thier entire degree free. Most people who complain about the cost of education in america either don't know or refuse to see this path. Probably graduating debt free is difficult, but anyone can rent a bedroom instead of an apartment, 100k may be ""bellow the national average"" but the average loan is for dumb people. Get your AA at a community college that works closely with a university for 30% of the university price, maybe live with your parents for that since any community college will do. Work part time making 20-30k a year to reduce the loan taken, and lastly some scholarships are hard, but most people qualify for financial aid, and many states have some sort of bright future scholarship that you are prety much garunteed if you have a decent grade. You do all these things and be careful that 100k can get cut in half, or even turn into 30k prety easily. I would add that your source has students living on campus. Which in my experience makes university far far more expensive. This forces you to overpay for thier trash rooms with shared quarters and also get thuer overpriced meal plan. Normally you can rent a bedroom out in town and cook for yourself in the kitchen for waaaaay cheaper. Tuition might be somewhat of a fixed cost, but cost of living is far from it. Students just refuse to think outside the box! Think about it. For the cost of one semesters campus living, you could probably buy a camper trailer and have it parked at a campsite with full hookup for $150 - $250 a month and be set for the rest of your time (don't say you don't have a truck, you can rent a pickup from home depot for under $50) I'm going to address this point by point. So to make sure I understand you, your point is that college costs aren't exorbitant. And then you are listing sixish different things people have to do as workarounds to try and get past the exorbitant price tag on college tuitions. Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. I never said it's a good system, I just said that it's not terribly hard to get away with less than a six figure loan and shooting for ""average"" in anything shouldn't be the goal. Also living on campus from my example is ""renting a room"", generally it's a shared room in a dorm. So you aren't cutting costs from that option there. Many people don't live within commuting distance to live at home and go to school. And if they do, then they will need transportation, so that costs money too. Holy shit, renting a room is cheaper than campus, that's been my point all allong. The study you referenced used data from students living in dorms on meal plans which grossly inflates college costs. The state university in my area isn't a huge city. Most students that rent bedrooms like I'm saying buy a $500 scooter. But keys be honest. This is america. Love it or hate it, you needed a car anyways. How will you ever get anywhere without a car? Needing a vehicle is not really an extra expense, and most kids probably already had a vehicle going into college. Damn near everyone I know did.If you can find a part time job for $15/hr (good luck but let's play it out) and can average 15 hours a week every week for the entire year and never have to take any significant time off for finals and stuff, then you made a whopping $11,700 for the year. Not to mention, like I said, intense programs often discourage you from working so you can ""focus on your studies"". Hopefully you don't mind starving half the time and utter exhaustion from working and going to school full time at the same time!You say ""good luck on $15/hr"" as if it's some exorbant amount. The federal min wage will be $15/hr next year, but that doesn't really matter, it's hardly a hard price floor already, every mcdonalds in my area starts at $16/hr, and speaking as someone who does 55hr work weeks and halftime college work. It's not that fucking hard, I still live a very fulfilling life with freetime. You can find a job paying $15-20 hr doing 20 hours a week all day every day and that's more than manageable on a full-time schedule. The goal with a part time job is not to get away debt free, it's just to be able to have enough cash to keep Most or all of your living expenses off the loan, 1500 month is realistic I think.Associate's degrees are great, particularly for trade jobs, but increasingly, jobs want a bachelors. Even for jobs that shouldn't need one. It's stupid. So if you don't want to go into a trade the associates isn't a viable option for you.Are you reading anything I'm writing? I didn't suggest only getting an AA. I suggested getting your AA at 25-33% of the university cost from a community college before transferring. Your bachelor's will still have a university name.... by doing this you cut tens of thousands from your tuition cost, and if you can do it while living with family, you probably save another ten thousand there. Many people do this. It saves money, it works. I'm curently doing it with my AA for my degree in finance, the community college I'm in works directly with out local state university, so as long as my GPA is good. I'm basically garunteed acceptance. Community college is an option and one I advocate for with younger generations in our current educational climate, but you aren't guaranteed acceptance into a university after. So you might just be screwing yourself if you pay out for a community college and later you can't get into a university for the degree you are pursuing. Your right, but like I just outlined, many community colleges work directly with universities. And I might add you aren't garunteed acceptance from high school either. Instead of blaming the people being shit on for not bringing an umbrella, we need to focus on the exploitation happening to our young people in the form of education. More and more jobs are requiring degrees, any degree. So people entering the work force are just screwed if they want to be successful at most careers. And we need people to be able to enter into all careers, not just the ones that have a lower education requirement. The cost of tuition in PUBLIC universities is exploitative. They need to be available and accessible to the public. It's literally what they are for. We have to stop gatekeeping higher education behind money. And we have to stop calling people doing their best to educate themselves ""stupid"" or ""gullible"". It's a damn diversion tactic to keep costs high while the plebeians fight each other. And you are falling right for it.I'm not falling for shit my friend. I agree with you. The system is trash. But it is what it is and it's not changing. Look how hard Biden has tried and failed to make a difference on it. When I'm presented with an issue like this I ask myself ""what can I control?"" Guess what, I can't control the tuition rate, I can't control that AA degrees costs are inflated with Gen Ed's that were mostly covered in high school. But I can control all the stuff I outlined. I'm sorry you thought I was trashing on people who are willing to roll over belly up and accept a six figure loan because ""that's what it is I'll wait for the government to fix it"" I was just trying to show that there are ways to mitigate how much you put on your loan.Universities are exploitative, employers do have unfair requirements, yes the government is giving us the shaft, but that's not what we are discussing, we are discussing the elements in our lives we have control over. You talk about plebians fighting eachother with the inference that that is me. That also makes you a plebian in your own example So you think sharing a dorm room and living on the campus meal plan is preferable to a camper? I would pick the camper in a heartbeat. Loads of safe parks, a comparable amount of space to a dorm room, and PRIVACY. But that's just one example. Renting a bedroom in a decent house with other students is still cheaper than dorms and better quality of life. Why do you insist dorms are the only way to go? It honestly seems like the worst option to me. I always hated that style of living.",reality sort high end use resource know use single form financial aid apply scholarship possible care frugal work time schooling actually statistically increase chance success people ivy league school graduate smaller student loan know lot people managed like know did got thier entire degree free people complain cost education america know refuse path probably graduating debt free difficult rent bedroom instead apartment bellow national average average loan dumb people aa community college work closely university university price maybe live parent community college work time making year reduce loan taken lastly scholarship hard people qualify financial aid state sort bright future scholarship prety garunteed decent grade thing careful cut half turn prety easily add source student living campus experience make university far far expensive force overpay thier trash room shared quarter thuer overpriced meal plan normally rent bedroom town cook kitchen waaaaay cheaper tuition somewhat fixed cost cost living far student just refuse think outside box think cost semester campus living probably buy camper trailer parked campsite hookup month set rest time say truck rent pickup home depot going address point point make sure understand point college cost exorbitant listing sixish different thing people workarounds try past exorbitant price tag college tuition yes exactly saying said good just said terribly hard away figure loan shooting average goal living campus example renting room generally shared room dorm cutting cost option people live commuting distance live home school need transportation cost money holy shit renting room cheaper campus point allong study referenced used data student living dorm meal plan grossly inflates college cost state university area huge city student rent bedroom like saying buy scooter key honest america love hate needed car anyways car needing vehicle really extra expense kid probably vehicle going college damn near know did time job hr good luck let play average hour week week entire year significant time final stuff whopping year mention like said intense program discourage working focus study hopefully mind starving half time utter exhaustion working going school time time say good luck hr exorbant federal min wage hr year doe really matter hardly hard price floor mcdonalds area start hr speaking doe work week halftime college work fucking hard live fulfilling life freetime job paying hr doing hour week day day manageable time schedule goal time job away debt free just able cash living expense loan month realistic think associate degree great particularly trade job increasingly job want bachelor job need stupid want trade associate viable option reading writing did suggest getting aa suggested getting aa university cost community college transferring bachelor university doing cut ten thousand tuition cost living family probably save thousand people save money work curently doing aa degree finance community college work directly local state university long gpa good basically garunteed acceptance community college option advocate younger generation current educational climate guaranteed acceptance university just screwing pay community college later ca university degree pursuing right like just outlined community college work directly university add garunteed acceptance high school instead blaming people shit bringing umbrella need focus exploitation happening young people form education job requiring degree degree people entering work force just screwed want successful career need people able enter career just one lower education requirement cost tuition public university exploitative need available accessible public literally stop gatekeeping higher education money stop calling people doing best educate stupid gullible damn diversion tactic cost high plebeian fight falling right falling shit friend agree trash changing look hard biden tried failed make difference presented issue like ask control guess ca control tuition rate ca control aa degree cost inflated gen ed covered high school control stuff outlined sorry thought trashing people willing roll belly accept figure loan wait government fix just trying way mitigate loan university exploitative employer unfair requirement yes government giving shaft discussing discussing element life control talk plebians fighting eachother inference make plebian example think sharing dorm room living campus meal plan preferable camper pick camper heartbeat load safe park comparable space dorm room privacy just example renting bedroom decent house student cheaper dorm better quality life insist dorm way honestly like worst option hated style living,687
codece,"I expect TransUnion will drop points again when it changes the loans to ""Closed"" because it will then adjust my credit age without those loans.Just FYI, accounts that were closed in good standing continue to age and add to your average age of accounts for 10 years after the date they were closed. You don't lose that history for another decade.Congrats! I was in the first round last summer, 55 years old here, similar to you. It was a real relief for me. This true of credit cards and other accounts as well btw. It's a common myth to ""never close your oldest credit card,"" but in reality it doesn't matter with respect to your age of accounts. You have 10 years to continue building credit before it falls off your history. On the other hand, accounts closed in *bad* standing, with derogatory remarks (like it was charged off, sold to a debt collector, defaulted, etc.) remain on your report for 7 years and will continue to drag your FICO score down for that long. This must depend on the credit reporting agency, no? No. Because when I consolidated my student loans VantageScore Vantage score isn't a credit reporting agency. It's an algorithm, that virtually no lender uses or cares about, that *calculates* a credit score based on information from the three major credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. I do not know of any major lender that uses a Vantage score to actually make a lending decision. Many of them, and many apps, like Credit Karma, provide a Vantage score because it's free. If you actually apply for credit, they will pull a FICO score. I have personally seen my FICO and Vantage scores differ by as much as 100 points, even using data from the same credit bureau. I've also seem them move in completely opposite directions with the same changes in usage and history. Apps and sites than use Vantage scoring spam me all the time. Nobody has ever e-mailed or messaged me saying ""your FICO score is looking *great*, good job! Maybe a new card is in your future!"" Or better, ""Codece, your FICO score might get better from a new card!"" FICO is a secret formula. It's a bunch of them. It's owned by the Fair Issac Corporation. They own it. They invented credit scoring. Your FICO score is what matters.FICO scoring models consider a closed account in good standing for 10 years in terms of calculating age. What I really don't understand is if your vantage score is useless and also does a poor job of approximating your FICO score then whats the point?Imo? It's used mostly by people trying to sell you something, tracking your usage of their product, how many times you view your score, and manipulating your fears about credit scores. It's used by 3rd party sites and apps who don't really care about your actual credit worthiness. Just like sub-prime mortgage lenders in the late 2000s didn't care. They're just getting a referral bonus, after that it doesn't matter to them.",expect transunion drop point change loan closed adjust credit age loan just fyi account closed good standing continue age add average age account year date closed lose history decade congrats round summer year old similar real relief true credit card account btw common myth close oldest credit card reality doe matter respect age account year continue building credit fall history hand account closed bad standing derogatory remark like charged sold debt collector defaulted remain report year continue drag fico score long depend credit reporting agency consolidated student loan vantagescore vantage score credit reporting agency algorithm virtually lender us care calculates credit score based information major credit bureau experian equifax transunion know major lender us vantage score actually make lending decision apps like credit karma provide vantage score free actually apply credit pull fico score personally seen fico vantage score differ point using data credit bureau completely opposite direction change usage history apps site use vantage scoring spam time mailed messaged saying fico score looking great good job maybe new card future better codece fico score better new card fico secret formula bunch owned fair issac corporation invented credit scoring fico score matter fico scoring model consider closed account good standing year term calculating age really understand vantage score useless doe poor job approximating fico score whats point imo used people trying sell tracking usage product time view score manipulating fear credit score used party site apps really care actual credit worthiness just like sub prime mortgage lender late did care just getting referral bonus doe matter,256
embiggenedmind,"Want to hear something even more disappointing? My mom was part of the second group. She got **$60,000** forgiven. It was a 25+ year old loan she never could get a handle on. Anyway, she voted for trump this last election because ""the economy."" Never mind the fact she has zero student debt for the first time in her life in over a quarter of a century. smdh Same. I don't even talk politics with them anymore. (I may have thrown in a, ""I hope you remember you're debt free when you vote"" a few months back, but that's it.) I don't want to read the news. If an influencer pops up on my feed wanting to tell me the craziest thing trump said or a republican did, I take an extra bit of effort and hit ""not interested."" My algorithm is 99% political-free. And I want to keep it that way. There's no sense in staying up to date if we literally have no control over the madness. If anything crazy happens, like trump attacks our allies or JD Vance gets caught cheating on his couch with a lazy boy, I'm sure it'll break through and wind up on my feed somewhere.

We don't need the late night talk show hosts and their jokes about the latest dumb thing [insert politician here] said about [insert culture war topic here.] Who cares? (Sorry, Colbert. Still love you tho.) We only need peace and to focus on what we can control, and that's only whatever is in front of us in our daily lives. Nothing we can control personally winds up on the news. (But don't forget to vote in 2 and 4 years.) Hey you do you. I completely understand. If something catastrophic happens, I guarantee I'll see it. It's not like I went looking for the news that Jack Smith's report is about to be released but I saw it. What I don't see on a day to day basis are the countless videos or opening monologues or news segment or article or think piece about the latest thing trump said or if Gaetz is running for governor of Florida or not-- that one concerns me and there's an article on it every other day. Is it in my consciousness somewhere? Of course. Does it benefit me or help prevent it from happening in any way to read about it every time I hop online? Fuck no. I'm concerned too. I have a daughter. A wife. A mom, as politically twisted as she may be. I have LGTBQ+ friends. I have really good friends who are minorities. I'm in an industry that thrives on immigrant work. I have a lot to lose too, so I wouldn't call my stance a luxury. But I can see where you get that. I consider it more like keeping my mind free of daily distractions. Even the left wing media wants you scared-- it's just done with more nuance and factual information than what you're going to get on Fox News or Joe Rogan's dumb shit. You can declutter the amount of information that's given to you. If anything affects you, your daughter, me, friends, or even people we may not even have a direct relationship with, we'll hear about it. I'm just sick of the endless articles and videos that rant on about the latest dumb thing said or threatened. Take this Greenland/Canada bullshit. We seriously should not be giving this more than 1% of our thought at this point. Because the alternative is reading each headline, slightly varied from the last, about how trump is threatening to do this, Musk is backing him, Trump Jr is visiting Greenland, oh wait they're homeless people in that photo, who. the. fuck. cares?

girl_of_squirrels,"Which forgiveness program are you asking about?The $10k/$20k forgiveness was blocked by the Supreme Court, so that ain't happening now. There are multiple forgiveness programs happening concurrently, and the big forgiveness groups recently are under:* The one-time IDR Adjustment after 20-25 years worth of repayment which people on this sub reference as ""golden emails"" * Starting Feb 2024 some have early forgiveness for low balances under SAVE (this is the $12k thing, it's 10 years worth of IDR payments *if* your original principal balance was under $12k and you're on the SAVE plan)* Others are getting Borrower Defense discharges, like the recent Art Institutes group discharge though it's worth noting that Borrower Defense to Repayment is a preexisting and ongoing program* Federal loan forgiveness/discharge programs are all listed here which includes but is not limited to PSLFIf you don't qualify for any of these programs *yet* you can still get yourself set up on the right trajectory. Public service employers and/or signing up for an IDR plan. The linear flow of time will cover the rest There is persistent misinformation on how bankruptcy works for student loans. It heavily depends on the loan type (federal vs qualified private vs non-qualified private loans) and your situation. It's not as easy, but it can be navigated in some cases I mean, you can have your loans forgiven once so if you qualify for 3 different forgiveness programs what actually matters is the one that triggers *first* to forgive the balance. If PSLF forgives all your loans then IDR forgiveness doesn't really matter for you specifically going forward Let's look at the actual employer requirements for PSLF as per **Qualifying Employment** Qualifying employment for PSLF isn't about the specific job that you do for your employer--it's about who you work for. Use our employer search tool to see if your employer qualifies for PSLF. Which Employer Types Are Eligible Eligible* U.S.-based government organizations at any level (federal, state, local, or tribal) - this includes the U.S. military * Not-for-profit organizations that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code * Other not-for-profit organizations that devote a majority of their full-time equivalent employees to providing certain qualifying public services Ineligible * For-profit organizations, including for-profit contracted organizations * Labor unions * Partisan political organizations Note: Serving as a full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for the PSLF Program.So if you work directly for a non-profit hospital (like Cedars-Sinai which is a 501(c)(3) organization) I can certify that employment for PSLF purposesDetails matter here If your hospital is listed then you work for a PSLF-qualifying employer. I would recheck your loan type and repayment plan and do the math to see if PSLF is the best route forward for you to handle your loans What did you see in the details for your PSLF Form? You said you applied and they said you didn't qualify *yet* but did they certify a payment count? Some x out of 120 payments number? It sounds like you've never read over the MPN for federal student loans then, so let's get you a link to the PDF version William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities Statement 16) REPAYING YOUR LOAN The repayment period for each Direct Subsidized Loan and Direct Unsubsidized Loan that you receive begins on the day after your grace period ends. We will notify you of the date your first payment is due. You must make payments on your loan even if you do not receive a bill or repayment notice. You must repay the principal amount of your loan, plus any interest charged on the loan in accordance with the Act. The principal amount that you owe, and are required to repay, is the total of all loan disbursements that are made (except for any disbursements that you reduce or cancel), plus any unpaid interest that is capitalized and added to the principal balance, as authorized under the Act. You must generally repay all of your Direct Loans under the same repayment plan. There are **two types of repayment plans: traditional repayment plans and income-driven repayment plans.** We will ask you to choose a repayment plan before your loans enter repayment. If you do not choose a repayment plan, we will place you on the Standard Repayment Plan, which may require you to make a higher monthly payment than other repayment plans. If you choose a repayment plan that reduces your monthly payment amount by extending the period of time you have to repay your loans or by basing your payment on your income, you will likely pay more in interest over time than you would pay on another repayment plan.There is more detail on the PDF but suffice to say **access to income-driven repayment plans that have built-in forgiveness as part of the repayment plan are built in to the loan agreement so anyone using an IDR plan is exactly following the terms and conditions of the loan they signed up for**. Access to PSLF is *also* clearly called out in the MPNThe borrowers *are* repaying their loans as per the loan terms. IDR plans and forgiveness programs are clearly written into the contract.

It's likely that the changes brought about by the SAVE plan regulations and other regulations that have made forgiveness easier over the past four years will be rolled back in some way. But we don't know in what way, or what those changes would mean for any given borrower. We also don't know what, if any, actions the incumbent Administration will take in the next few weeks, before they leave office.Changes may also depend on whether Republicans control the House or not (they are already projected to win Senate control). As of the time of this post, that is also unknown.All of the above are fair game to discuss in this thread (consistent with the regular rules of the sub -- esp. Rule 7) as is speculation about what new/different student loan policies the new Trump Administration or Congress may implement, beyond merely undoing Biden Administration rules. ""Getting rid of ED"" is a misleading promise, at best. Even if the Department stopped issuing new direct loans and Pell Grants, the government would still own and need to service the existing debts for many years. (And ED does much, much more than just student aid -- those other functions would also need to be wound down over many years or transferred to other departments, meaning that ED would sort of ""move"" not disappear.) This would also require an act of Congress; presidents can't eliminate agencies on their own.If we assume that a law is passed and ED instantly stops issuing new Federal Student Aid money (grants, work-study, and loans), then there would be chaos in higher education. Many current students would need to drop out because they could not afford the price without aid. Other students might be able to transfer to cheaper schools, but for a lower-quality education. There would be significant pressure on schools to lower costs to what students could afford, though at the expense of quality. Some of the most expensive schools would not have to adjust much, however, since they already cater to wealthier students and have massive endowments built upon historical wealth. Harvard and Yale will be fine. But anyone who needs aid to attend a top-tier university will not be -- we'll return to a pre-1970s-ish time when college is only available to students whose families can and will help them financially to do so and it's not an option for everyone else.Private lenders will still be involved in the market, but that industry is not equipped to offset new loans that the government originates every year ([$75,556,035,663 in 2023-24]( and all of the current ills and risks of private student loans would remain. Some students would go for them, but it would still be largely those students whose families are financially secure enough to co-sign. The big policy idea of federal student loans was that the government would take on the risk of default, which would then open doors for lower-income students to succeed. Private lenders weren't taking that risk before and still won't today, effectively barring millions of Americans from higher education solely because they didn't grow up rich enough. Private student loans can also be discharged in bankruptcy. Though I expect you'll have significant difficulty getting a personal loan to refinance your student loan if the amount is at all substantial.You'd also lose the few perks available for private student loans, like the tax deduction on student loan interest and tax-free employer student loan repayment. If the moneys wiped they can't reinstate irSUPREME COURT (bursting through the wall like the Kool Aid man): *We* decide what the president can't do! A court can't ""unvaccinate"" someone who has already gotten the jab. A court *could* say ""you still owe this money even though someone else said you don't."" i personally dont think they can get rid of things like saveGiven that all of SAVE has already been blocked by multiple court orders, this is one of the *easier* things an incoming administration could do. All that would need to happen is the new Department of Justice would dismiss its current appeals defending SAVE. The lower courts would then make their orders blocking the plan effective permanently and SAVE would be gone.Now, the SAVE regulation did a *lot* more than just create SAVE. And SAVE itself wasn't a new plan, it was revised rules for the existing REPAYE plan. So the specifics of what those court orders would do is uncertain -- would only the SAVE parts be blocked, or the entire regulation? Would SAVE revert to the old REPAYE rules or would REPAYE and SAVE both completely disappear? What would that mean for borrowers already on SAVE?We don't know, but I suspect that we're going to find out. At the moment, we don't know what ""adjustments"" the new Trump Administration will try to do. For something like undoing a Biden Administration policy that was implemented through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, the new Admin could just repeal it the same way, with a new notice-and-comment rule.More significant changes might require Congressional action or be blocked by courts, but it really depends on what the change is. It's usually much easier and simpler to revert to a prior system (even if it's broken) than to fix the system. Depends on how you define ""screwed"" I guess. I would expect there to be fewer avenues to getting forms of relief or forgiveness; and the paths that remain will likely be administratively harder to access.But it's not like the Administration can make your loans *worse* -- they're still governed by the contract you signed (the MPN). Your interest rate won't *increase* or anything crazy like that.",rule reddiquette site rule illegal topic covered sub donald trump apparent president elect politics megathread donald trump elected president united state worldnews world reacts trump presidential victory appears imminent news donald trump win term historic return white house studentloans megathread topic thread locked deleted moment significant speculation concrete information incoming administration change president biden student loan policy likely change brought save plan regulation regulation forgiveness easier past year rolled way know way change mean given borrower know action incumbent administration week leave office change depend republican control house projected win senate control time post unknown fair game discus thread consistent regular rule sub esp rule speculation new different student loan policy new trump administration congress implement merely undoing biden administration rule getting rid ed misleading promise best department stopped issuing new direct loan pell grant government need service existing debt year ed doe just student aid function need wound year transferred department meaning ed sort disappear require act congress president ca eliminate agency assume law passed ed instantly stop issuing new federal student aid money grant work study loan chaos higher education current student need drop afford price aid student able transfer cheaper school lower quality education significant pressure school lower cost student afford expense quality expensive school adjust cater wealthier student massive endowment built historical wealth harvard yale fine need aid attend tier university return pre ish time college available student family help financially option private lender involved market industry equipped offset new loan government originates year current ill risk private student loan remain student largely student family financially secure sign big policy idea federal student loan government risk default open door lower income student succeed private lender taking risk wo today effectively barring million american higher education solely did grow rich private student loan discharged bankruptcy expect significant difficulty getting personal loan refinance student loan substantial lose perk available private student loan like tax deduction student loan tax free employer student loan repayment money wiped ca reinstate irsupreme court bursting wall like kool aid man decide president ca court ca unvaccinate gotten jab court say owe money said personally dont think rid thing like savegiven save blocked multiple court order easier thing incoming administration need happen new department justice dismiss current appeal defending save lower court make order blocking plan effective permanently save gone save regulation did lot just create save save new plan revised rule existing repaye plan specific court order uncertain save part blocked entire regulation save revert old repaye rule repaye save completely disappear mean borrower save know suspect going moment know adjustment new trump administration try like undoing biden administration policy implemented notice comment rulemaking process new admin just repeal way new notice comment rule significant change require congressional action blocked court really depends change usually easier simpler revert prior broken fix depends define screwed guess expect fewer avenue getting form relief forgiveness path remain likely administratively harder access like administration make loan worse governed contract signed mpn rate wo increase crazy like,499
hotjambalaya17,"[ the College Cost Reduction Act, federal student loan repayment options would be narrowed down to just two: a Standard plan, and a new IDR plan called the ""Repayment Assistance Plan."" This new plan would be based on income just like existing IDR plans, and would use a formula similar to the PAYE and REPAYE plans. However, it would eliminate student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years in repayment. Instead, borrowers would only qualify for loan forgiveness once they have repaid ""the total amount of principal and interest that the borrower would have repaid under a standard repayment plan."" Some lower-income borrowers or those with high balances may never pay that amount, which could lead to some people being trapped in debt for their entire lives. **Under the current version of the bill, the changes would apply to ""All loans made... on or after July 1, 2024."" This suggests that borrowers already in repayment would be able to maintain access to existing IDR plans**."" Tech college is the key. Or trades apprenticeships. The four year model of college was something our parents and grandparents aspired to. It meant that they might be able to work in an air conditioned office, sit down all day, and get a couple of weeks of paid vacation/holidays every year. I don't believe the cost of education is worth it for those types of jobs any longer. My son in law is an electrician apprentice and he makes close to $50K/year at age 21; he'll make $75-80K in the next three years and then be able to own his own business. He spent $0 on his education. A tech school will cost about $1800/semester and books are usually included. Nurses, sonographers, etc make $80K to start--Yes it's a tough job with long shifts, holiday work, etc, but it is a valuable career, low debt and high employability. It's hard for me to even think of a terminal 4 year degree (one that does not require more debt for a masters or doctorate) that gets anywhere close to these starting salaries. Let's abandon the idea that four year colleges make kids more well rounded and instead focus on training the next generation of healthcare and trades professionals. That will solve the student loan problem and the underemployment problem for many grads. No. PSLF is written in a law passed by congress. For that to end, congress would have to pass a law. I guess that could happen, but unlikely given the constituents in each state/district would not be happy with their rep. I'm gonna try to be optimistic. Yes, the repayment plans will be more restrictive than those that were implemented under Biden. However, it is not as black and white as Biden-Good, Trump-Bad. If you read further down in the article, you'll see other elements that will mirror some of what Biden implemented. As a recipient of loan forgiveness under Biden I am grateful for it. However, the implementation was horrible. If you're a loan holder, you know the long wait times for a call to go thru, representatives that don't know the system (after holding the balance for over 30 years, I know the process better than any of them did), random irrelevant letters or emails etc. The uncertainty was probably the worst part--hearing about a relief plan, then having it reversed because it was not legal, or getting no updates for a year or more knowing that you qualified for relief but it was never processed. A new program seemed to be rolled out every other month and no one was equipped to implement it, leading to borrower frustration. Maybe this will simplify things and bring more people to debt relief. Below is another quote from the article that highlights some of these elements, which student loan advocate groups support.# Other Elements Of Proposal Would Impact Origination And Other Student Loan Forgiveness ProgramsThe elimination of time-based IDR student loan forgiveness is not the only item in the GOP-sponsored College Cost Reduction Act. Other provisions, which some borrower advocates would support, include:* The elimination of the Parent PLUS and Graduate PLUS loan programs. Some advocates support this move, as these loans tend to have higher interest rates and can leave parents and older borrowers stuck in significant debt. However, other advocates are concerned that eliminating these programs would force borrowers to rely on riskier private student loans that don't qualify for IDR or loan forgiveness and typically have inflexible repayment terms.* A second chance for borrowers in default on their student loans to get back into good standing through the federal student loan rehabilitation program.* An interest subsidy for the new IDR plan ""for each month for which a borrower' s aggregate monthly payment... is insufficient to pay the total amount of interest that accrues on a loan for the month,"" as well as the ability for payments to go directly towards principal in certain circumstances.* The elimination of most instances of interest capitalization.* A repeal of the Biden administration's ""gainful employment,"" Borrower Defense to Repayment, and Closed School Discharge regulations, and a limitation on the ability of future presidential administration to draft new regulations expanding student loan forgiveness initiatives. At a macro level, loaned money is never free. Inflation continues every year leading to a diminished value of the dollar. What you could buy for $4.00 10 years ago is now probably $8 or $9 (think fast food). So, if the lender, government or bank, does not charge interest, then they are losing money by lending it. Someone is going to take a bath when money is lent and the recipient signs up to take on the interest. If the government lends out money with no interest, then the value of that money plummets over time. And, if that happens, college costs will go up as those schools have the most to gain while the economy tanks. Borrowed money is never free.",college cost reduction act federal student loan repayment option narrowed just standard plan new idr plan called repayment assistance plan new plan based income just like existing idr plan use formula similar paye repaye plan eliminate student loan forgiveness year repayment instead borrower qualify loan forgiveness repaid total principal borrower repaid standard repayment plan lower income borrower high balance pay lead people trapped debt entire life current version change apply loan july suggests borrower repayment able maintain access existing idr plan tech college key trade apprenticeship year model college parent grandparent aspired meant able work air conditioned office sit day couple week paid vacation holiday year believe cost education worth type job longer son law electrician apprentice make close year age make year able business spent education tech school cost semester book usually included nurse sonographers make start yes tough job long shift holiday work valuable career low debt high employability hard think terminal year degree doe require debt master doctorate get close starting salary let abandon idea year college make kid rounded instead focus training generation healthcare trade professional solve student loan problem underemployment problem grad pslf written law passed congress end congress pas law guess happen unlikely given constituent state district happy rep gon na try optimistic yes repayment plan restrictive implemented biden black white biden good trump bad read article element mirror biden implemented recipient loan forgiveness biden grateful implementation horrible loan holder know long wait time representative know holding balance year know process better did random irrelevant letter email uncertainty probably worst hearing relief plan having reversed legal getting update year knowing qualified relief processed new program rolled month equipped implement leading borrower frustration maybe simplify thing bring people debt relief quote article highlight element student loan advocate group support element proposal impact origination student loan forgiveness programsthe elimination time based idr student loan forgiveness item gop sponsored college cost reduction act provision borrower advocate support include elimination parent plus graduate plus loan program advocate support loan tend higher rate leave parent older borrower stuck significant debt advocate concerned eliminating program force borrower rely riskier private student loan qualify idr loan forgiveness typically inflexible repayment term second chance borrower default student loan good standing federal student loan rehabilitation program subsidy new idr plan month borrower aggregate monthly payment insufficient pay total accrues loan month ability payment directly principal certain circumstance elimination instance capitalization repeal biden administration gainful employment borrower defense repayment closed school discharge regulation limitation ability future presidential administration draft new regulation expanding student loan forgiveness initiative macro level loaned money free inflation continues year leading diminished value dollar buy year ago probably think fast food lender government bank doe charge losing money lending going bath money lent recipient sign government lends money value money plummet time happens college cost school gain economy tank borrowed money free,472
indy1386,"This \^\^\^You combine all that with people that don't have the gift from a parent like OP. That come from literally nothing and have a dream of making something for themselves. work hard through school and then the market crashes and nobody is paying or hiring. and the ones paying are paying very little with next to nothing raises each year that force them to jump around to make a decent living. Which is a cost in itself, the stress of a new job, location most of the time leads to many other insecurities. In order to jump around to make a better salary most people that do that are single. Imagine uprooting a family every year or two. so those people are typically single and already paying a higher cost to live on there own so paying those loans back become even more difficult. Its just one of those that your damned if you do damned if you dont. Basically you stay single you can bounce around and make a higher salary easier. But you pay for it by having to fend for yourself.If you get married and have someone you trust then you can benifit by splitting bills and progressing, but this typically comes with kids wich are not cheap these days. Typically both parents need to work wich leaves daycare and daycare costs are insane. Yes, you could have a parent stay home and take care of the kid but now you have one salary taking care of a family, and in todays world not as easy as it was for our parents and even they had a tougher time then our grands wich was the norm. Its one of those things that makes you think its designed to keep people down but the reality is that people suck and will always find a way to exploit a situation. This. if you fail to use the degree you are out of luck. I graduated in 08 and I was lucky to find work. But I know a bunch of people that came out with that loan and no job. 30k is less then the average public in state total tuition currently.... But you are an awesome parent. I could not imagine a huge chunk like that being taken away from mine. That 100-200 a month is a big bill for most families. Good job getting ahead of things and helping out! Seems like your son is a hard worker and deserves every bit. average in state public tutition not staying on campus is 27,940 a year. So yes it would cover a year. And to be honest that 30k knocked off of what would be about 120k at the end (if OP's son goes to in state college and doesn't stay on campus) adds up a ton. Imagine paying down 90 vs 120. I wanted a good education. I went to a top school for my profession at the time. Unfortunately the market crashed when I graduated in 2008 so fortunately I had that good Education and I was able to get a job in a time where nobody was hiring. The sad part is the pay was hot garbage. although it was nothing to sneeze at it was far less then I had planned for knowing I was taking out 110k for school. Half went towards tuition (this covered books, software, anything I needed to graduate. The school provided with cost of tuition, I didnt go buy the top of the line PC or anything) Half went towards living expenses for the 2 years I was in school. I was in class physically 40 hrs a week and typically had external class work so I was busy with my education easily 50-70 hrs a week. I did not have time to have a job and nobody did that went to school with me. I decided to get my BA in comp sci at an accelerated rate because I didn't want to party and I knew the real experience was out in the world. unfortunately it took 10 years before I was making what I expected to make when I got out of school. Now I could certainly have jumped around company to company and made more money, but my morals got the best of me and I always wanted to see projects through. Money was less important to me then the work I was doing. So, I was on income based repayment all of that time. I have payed over 80k back to which 55k is interest. The majority of that has been in the passed 2 years as that Im finally able to afford doing so. All this to say its not just high balances, or misunderstanding of loans. I would argue that these loans are predatory. Most people are stuck paying them there lives and only because they were not born into money or financially responsible parent or ones that cared. Say I had those living expenses paid for. I doubt Id be in any school debt at this point. Id be paid off long ago. The creditors should not be giving out such loans, school cost should be better subsidized. to simply say its high balances and people not understanding debt is an oversimplification of the matter at hand. Should people not have the opportunity for a good education? Also my generation was told you had to go to college if you wanted to have a good life. and if you did so you would. Sadly, a lot of people go to college blind and not know what they want to do and lack the drive. then they get out with a worthless education and a bill and end up working the same job they could have without that job. I do love that more information is getting presented to persuade the upcoming generation to go to trade schools. College isn't for everyone.[ not 30k wont cover the cost of the average in state public 4 year tuition. but it sure makes a good dent which is nice!!. I wish I had such a gift to start off with.TLDR: You're not wrong high balances are a problem. lack of education of loans and percentage rates are also a huge problem.

ironboy157,"I think the political dysfunction around student loans has been a net benefit to borrowers since March of 2020. By the time the SAVE plan gets axed( if it does), it will be 5 years of no interest for many people. The next four years will probably go back to the status quo, making payments and many people's balances growing while on IDRs. I think there is no chance there will be more forgiveness even if Harris wins. With that said, the balances will still exist and they will grow. The ballooning student debt is never going to be repaid. So as long as the problem exists, some politicians will attempt to forgive some loans. I imagine the democratic nominee in 2028 will be espousing some type of forgiveness. My personal strategy has been unchanged. I pay whatever the lowest legal payment is and I invest my savings in the S&P500. Maybe there will be some attempt to reduce interest, forgive some balances, or something else. In the mean time, whatever extra payments I could make are growing in the S&P. If there is some financial crises, there is a higher chance on action of student loans. Some people started repaying, it depends which plan you were on and which tax year they used to calculate your payment. There are many borrowers whose SAVE plan payments was Zero or very near Zero. Additionally, since income verification is also constantly delayed, the income being used to calculate payments can be from 2019. Its all kind of luck.If Trump is elected, and SAVE is eliminated, the earliest I could see interest accruing again would be march of 2025, so 5 years after the covid pause. Maybe he would turn it on in February. Well people do kill themselves over student loans, but federal student loans are not the same as owing to a loanshark.The balances do have an effect on your life, but much of that can be minimized. If the 20/25 year forgiveness is eliminated, I think it will hurt a lot of people. My strategy isn't even a bet on a greater return. It is more ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"".I would rather have $1 in savings than give that dollar to my loan balance. If i could take a 100K federal student loan today and just put the 100K in the S&P, I would.Now the situation for the past few years has been even better, not only has the interest been Zero for some people- some of the time, but there was high inflation. So value of that debt has been reduced.This is the type of random event you get to take advantage of if you don't try to pay down the balance. Now many people feel immense stress from owning debt, but federal student loan debt is among the best debt you could own. Well when you buy the S&P you aren't trying to beat the market.....Inflation is good. It means the value of your debt decreases over time and salaries tend to go up at least with adjustments around inflation. Any person who has sent a single dollar ""attacking their student loans"" for the past 5 years have just lost money. The play, in hindsight, was to take every dollar you would put toward loans and invest it. Since the student loan pause started in 2020, the S&P is up like 250%. If you were capable of making the standard 10 year payment, and put that payment every month in the S&P500 for the past 4.5 years, your balance is higher than the loan balance. So you could now pay off the whole loan amount. That was a game I won. I don't suggest relying on loan forgiveness, just being open to it, if it does happen. Debt, in general can be good. Federal student loans are essentially the best kind of debt to have, except for maybe mortgage debt. When there are recessions, guess what? The government becomes more ""kind"" to borrowers. If I owed 100K today and had 100K in cash, would I pay off my loans? Absolutely not. Keep your 100K, invest it and make the monthly payments, and that would be without the interest pause. The market goes up and down, but guess what, you never have to sell. Telling people they need to attack their loans isn't the most helpful advice. Some people are stressed by having any debt, they should pay their loans as fast as possible. For anyone who is comfortable seeing big numbers on a screen, using your money in the most productive way is the way to go, and that is often not paying the loans any faster than the law requires. The morbid benefit of federal student loans is they are cancelled when you die. So if you have some savings and you die, your family gets your savings but not your debt.But you are always more valuable to your family alive then dead, just no point in paying down federals loans rather then building savings. I am not a lawyer so IDK the odds that it gets removed. I just read the discussions from one of the cases. The other concern is even if the 20/25 year forgiveness stays around a republican administration can do everything in their power to not enact it. With IDRs you only have to pay 10-15% of your income. If you want to be as morbid as possible, the best thing you can do for your family is pay your 10-15% tax, save whatever you can in 401Ks/HSAs or whatever account you can. Then at the 20-25 year mark you get the tax bomb. You won't be able to pay that and the IRS will make you a deal or they do something that is better than a loan shark.You are always more valuable to your family alive both in the time they spend with you and the financial support you provide. There are plenty of people who currently have a balance higher than they would have repaid with the standard plan, i think those people may be ok with that rule. I don't they would back track capitalized interest, but there are a few borrowers who would benefit front his structure.",think political dysfunction student loan net benefit borrower march time save plan get axed doe year people year probably status quo making payment people balance growing idrs think chance forgiveness harris win said balance exist grow ballooning student debt going repaid long problem exists politician attempt forgive loan imagine democratic nominee espousing type forgiveness personal strategy unchanged pay lowest legal payment invest saving maybe attempt reduce forgive balance mean time extra payment make growing financial crisis higher chance action student loan people started repaying depends plan tax year used calculate payment borrower save plan payment zero near zero additionally income verification constantly delayed income used calculate payment kind luck trump elected save eliminated earliest accruing march year covid pause maybe turn february people kill student loan federal student loan owing loanshark balance effect life minimized year forgiveness eliminated think hurt lot people strategy bet greater return bird hand worth bush saving dollar loan balance federal student loan today just situation past year better zero people time high inflation value debt reduced type random event advantage try pay balance people feel immense stress owning debt federal student loan debt best debt buy trying beat market inflation good mean value debt decrease time salary tend adjustment inflation person sent single dollar attacking student loan past year just lost money play hindsight dollar loan invest student loan pause started like capable making standard year payment payment month past year balance higher loan balance pay loan game won suggest relying loan forgiveness just open doe happen debt general good federal student loan essentially best kind debt maybe mortgage debt recession guess government kind borrower owed today cash pay loan absolutely invest make monthly payment pause market go guess sell telling people need attack loan helpful advice people stressed having debt pay loan fast possible comfortable seeing big number screen using money productive way way paying loan faster law requires morbid benefit federal student loan cancelled die saving die family get saving debt valuable family alive dead just point paying federal loan building saving lawyer idk odds get removed just read discussion case concern year forgiveness stay republican administration power enact idrs pay income want morbid possible best thing family pay tax save hsas account year mark tax bomb wo able pay irs make deal better loan shark valuable family alive time spend financial support provide plenty people currently balance higher repaid standard plan think people ok rule track capitalized borrower benefit structure,408
kungfuenglish,"Why isolate it to federal loans and only up to 100k??These exclusionary policies and limits are bs.And truthfully, democrats have solidified themselves over time as the party of excluding certain people based on arbitrary limits and that has pushed a lot of people away from the Democratic Party. It's an aura of unfairness. In a free in state university system, how do you propose the cost of living is handled?As it is, in state tuition is 2000-3000/semester = $6000/year. But people take out 30k/year in loans. Why? Because 25k is for cost of living. What's your solution to that? This whole thread reads as ""fuck you I want mine"" though. Why not give $10k to every American instead?No. It sounds like you want 30-50k for yourselves instead because of arbitrarily getting student loans. Which actually is advantageous to you in life. It's exclusionary and regressive. But fuck everyone else get yours right? You deserve it more. don't understand the authors reasoning at allI suspect it's ""republicans bad"" and not much deeper than that. Would this include loans that we have already refinanced and consolidated? If my tuition was free my student loan burden would be about 250k instead of 350k for 4 years of undergrad (20k) and 4 years of med school (80k). The rest is cost of living expenses that pay rent and food and stuff that is covered by student loans. Do you want taxes to pay for people's cost of living too?If not, how do you rectify this deficit?Undergrad loans for state school are 20k/ year: only 5 of that is tuition and fees. Even if living in dorms is required. It's still paying for rent. Why pay for that but not off campus? That's not fair. Pay for state school tuitionNot cost of livingPeople need to pay their own cost of living no matter where they live. They shouldn't get free housing just because they are in college. Why shouldn't non college attendees get free housing?Offer loans for cost of living. Anyone can take out personal loans for that amount. So these are a better value. But have to be paid back. It's not a choice to ""live"" though. Why should some living be free and other living not be? living costs are too high for college studentsDude living costs are living costs. Living costs are high for everyone. That's the entire point. Why should tax money pay for college students to live for free and not others?And supply food to students because farmers get subsidies? Ok fine. Why doesn't everyone else get free food too then?If you want to pay for cost of living for college students for 4 years out of taxes then that's a fine platform. But you have to justify why that select group of adult humans in America get free living expenses for 4 years and not the rest of America. You want to give every person 80k to cover 4 years living expenses when they turn 18? Go for it. That you could actually justify and reason. No reason it should be only for college students. I'm being serious. Why should college dorm living be free? And food too? I seriously don't understand why it should be free for some people to live but not others. Why students and not young adults that are working instead and can't make enough to cover costs?It doesn't have to be fair but it HAS to be justified. And no, WE don't have to ""get this idea of fairness out of our minds"". You need to get it into your mind. Until the people of the USA vote for unfairness, it doesn't get to just be implemented against the will of the people. The people voted against unfair exclusionary policies like this. So if you want to make change you run on policies people will vote for. But it's NOT a part of tuition. Why do dorm stayers get free food but people who live at home with their parents don't?What do you do about spending money? Do you give an allowance too? Why should taxes go towards spending money for others?Spending money is part of room and board calculations right now. Because a 30k student loan payment is like $50/moA 30k car payment over 5 years is like $600/moIf you paid 600/mo to your student loans it would be paid off in 5 years too. So to pay it off in double the time as a car loan it costs half as much. Yes. I'm specifically referring to the income based plans. Or even just 25 year repayment plan that is offered without income based plans. Many people opt for those so of course they aren't paid off in 5 years. Paying $50-100/mo isn't going to get you very far. It's like paying the minimum on a credit card bill. Yea probably still most common. Doesn't mean that ""many"" don't take the plans. Many does not mean most. But the real answer to the parent question is: most people WHO COMPLAIN ON REDDIT take the income driven plans. And then obviously fall behind because they never have any plan to make up for it and in 5 years wonder why their balance is higher than it started. MOST people coming out of college get a degree and job that pays well enough to pay off loans in 10 years. So they don't have the problem recited in the OP and never post about it on Reddit either.",isolate federal loan exclusionary policy limit b truthfully democrat solidified time party excluding certain people based arbitrary limit pushed lot people away democratic party aura unfairness free state university propose cost living handled state tuition semester year people year loan cost living solution thread read fuck want american instead sound like want instead arbitrarily getting student loan actually advantageous life exclusionary regressive fuck right deserve understand author reasoning alli suspect republican bad deeper include loan refinanced consolidated tuition free student loan burden instead year undergrad year med school rest cost living expense pay rent food stuff covered student loan want tax pay people cost living rectify deficit undergrad loan state school year tuition fee living dorm required paying rent pay campus fair pay state school tuitionnot cost livingpeople need pay cost living matter live free housing just college non college attendee free housing offer loan cost living personal loan better value paid choice live living free living living cost high college studentsdude living cost living cost living cost high entire point tax money pay college student live free supply food student farmer subsidy ok fine doe free food want pay cost living college student year tax fine platform justify select group adult human america free living expense year rest america want person cover year living expense turn actually justify reason reason college student college dorm living free food seriously understand free people live student young adult working instead ca make cover cost doe fair justified idea fairness mind need mind people usa vote unfairness doe just implemented people people voted unfair exclusionary policy like want make change run policy people vote tuition dorm stayer free food people live home parent spending money allowance tax spending money spending money room board calculation right student loan payment like moa car payment year like moif paid mo student loan paid year pay double time car loan cost half yes specifically referring income based plan just year repayment plan offered income based plan people opt course paid year paying mo going far like paying minimum credit card yea probably common doe mean plan doe mean real answer parent question people complain reddit income driven plan obviously fall plan make year wonder balance higher started people coming college degree job pay pay loan year problem recited op post reddit,384
milespoints,"I think you would benefit more from some context. The current ""problem"" with student loans from a public policy perspective is that the federal govt has, for too long, written a blank check to universities by being willing to lend ""whatever the schooling costs"". This has resulted in amounts borrowed and, as a result, student loan balances skyrocketing. Everyone agrees on this, republicans and democrats alike. The democratic solution has been to try to decrease monthly loan payments and diverge total amount paid from total amount borrowed. Basically, with SAVE and the like, it matters less and less how much you borrow, as you just make (very affordable) income based repayments and eventually the remaining balance just gets forgiven. This would probably result in an ever increasing subsidy in the form of forgiveness (schools could keep charging more and more, and there is no real cost control or limit). Note that there a lot of things going for this policy, but it does introduce a type of moral hazard. You can keep borrowing more and more, and since it all gets forgiven (and most people do not pay taxes on the amount forgiven) you don't really pay anything extra.The republican solution is to go completely the other direction. Republicans do not like open-ended government subsidies. Republicans want to make loans MORE burdensome, not less, in order to incentivize people to borrow less and to incentivize schools to charge less. This proposal achieves this by keeping the payments affordable but getting rid of that 20-25 year forgiveness get out of jail free card. To me there is an intuitive fairness to say ""Everyone pays back the amount they borrowed and the interest they signed up for"". Fair is square. You borrowed the money. It also caps loan amounts to prevent universities from continuing to jack up tuition. So is this good policy? God no. If this entire thing has taught us much is that your average 18 year old is, financially speaking, noy very sharp. Most 18 year olds do not ""respond to financial incentives"" like that. They will continue to borrow as much as they need to graduate from their school of choice, and then just make payments forever, until they die. Even worse, because this plan caps loan amounts, it would make people go borrow from private lenders, where there is no IDR. While there is some sort of inherent cost control included here (private lenders probably won't lend you $500k for your gender studies PhD or whatever, they wanna get repaid), it's not gonna do much (there is still a lot of room for americans to pay more for loans)But if you think, like most republicans, that the problem with student loan policy is that the government has subsidies that are just too generous, this bill fixes that. You can't really allow student loan debt to be discharged like that. Most young graduates have no assets. So it would quickly become standard process to just file chapter 7 immediately after college graduation (no assets to lose anyway, and very few people need clean credit to buy a house or the like at age 24). Then start rebuilding credit, and be in tip top shape to get any loan you might want when the BK falls off in 7 years, which would be like age 28 I mean, i am not a big fan of this bill for all the reasons mentioned, but those two shouldn't be mutually exclusive. You can have both accessible and cost-effective education! My own opinion is that the GOP plan would be decent with one modification - if it would require universities to accept the capped federal student loan disbursement as payment in full for tuition and fees. In other words, you either take federal loans or not. If you do, you can't ""balance bill"" the student. This is how federal NSF fellowships for PhD students work Why do you think that? Tbh we can bring back the entire cost control that we used to have by just including a provision in the loan terms that the school must accept the federal loan disbursement as payment in full My guess is that republicans don't wanna do that because it would decimate the private student loan industry I mean, the current 20-25 year IDR forgiveness is essentially that, just with a longer timeline. Again, the point is that you don't want to incentivize people to strategically declare bankruptcy to shed their student loans. Being able to do that at even 10 years after graduation would probably result in tons of people going that route Yes. And people were abusing it, which is why we got rid of that.

mindmapsofficial,"Did some quick calculations and this really doesn't confer a real substantial benefit to any group compared to existing* IDR plans.Basically it makes those in the lower income brackets with high debt will never pay off their loans. High income, low debt people never benefitted off IDR plans in the first place.Mid income, mid debt people are the only group that get a benefit sometimes, but its marginal. Some quick calculations: legislation seems to be more deterrence to borrowing so people don't engage in the moral hazard of over borrowing. However, if you ask most people, they don't take out 300k+ in loans with a plan to make $30k per year. Sometimes life just happens and doesn't go as planned.For example, someone with 10k in debt and an income of $30k would be paying for 18 years. Someone making 100k with 140k of debt would be paying for 25.2 years. Also, if you have kids, it's not more forgiving, unlike existing* IDR plans. Your payment is lower, but you just have to make it up with more overall payments. Similarly, 401k and HSA contributions don't confer a benefit since your reduced payments need to be made up later in life. I added existing* to clarify The salary is adjustable. Feel free to edit the spreadsheet after making a copy. I understand that it's more forgiving than having only the standard plan, buts it's actually less forgiving than existing IDR plans I literally have been giving student loan advice on the internet for about a year and a half. I couldn't even communicate this information to my 18 year old brother in a manner sufficient to get him to change his mind. Social pressure to go to college and certain colleges can outweigh being rational, especially in teenagers. You can argue that they were of legal age and signed a contract. However, most underwriters for other loans would never enter into that contract with them. The real solution is finding a way to bring the costs of education down. Well, there are infinitely possible forms of the same plan that would be equally fair, yet they chose this one. They could've done 5% of your discretionary income or 15% of one's discretionary income. They could've used a 5-year amortization period as the standard for these purposes. Why did they choose this variation of ""fair"" It's uncommon to not grandfather something in. Everything can be legally changed, including the constitution so it's a matter of probability rather than possibility. It's unlikely they take you off current plans but not impossible Your wages are garnished, which is at a higher income percent than IDR plans with no discretionary income reduction Education and training is different. Most jobs don't really require heavy education. I would say that K-12 education is sufficient for 80+% of people. This is generally funded through property taxes. I have a law degree and practice law. Little would have changed in my practice if I went straight to my job after the first year of law school. Jobs use education and grades as a way to find the ""good employees."" Grades and scores are one of the few ""hard signals"" that employers can rely upon, so they do just that. Training on the other hand is generally footed by employers. Most difficult jobs, your employment is at a loss the first few months since it's inefficient and likely prone to errors. Additionally, the person training you has to do their job plus train you. Because dems made it an issue, and republicans responded by opposing the dem's attempt to address that issue Also implemented SAVE Because SAVE had a 225% poverty guideline multiplier and a 100% interest subsidy, compared to 150% multiplier and a 50% subsidy under REPAYE. SAVE is much more generous than other plans for low income borrowers.SAVE was enacted similarly to PAYE and REPAYE so when the litigation of SAVE was enacted, PAYE and REPAYE came under threat since they were passed under the same process. Agreed. Otherwise, we either have (i) runaway student loan debt or (ii) lack of access. This shifts treasury payments from the wealthy to the working class (regressive) so it does confer some benefit to the hyper wealthy from a tax perspective For federal taxation, there's an insolvency exception, as described in my post that I also recently responded to your comment. Additionally, student loan forgiveness is exempt at the federal level from taxation until the end of 2025. After which, congress can decide to extend the exemption or let it lapse.Loan debt forgiveness, in general, has been taxable for a very long time so these laws aren't new by any means. 255k. No, it is a minor concern. I just pay my income based repayment and focus on investing and paying off my mortgage.It's literally my last priority since it can be reduced if my income decreases and the government can't foreclose on my degree.If you haven't maxed out your 401k for the year, it typically does not make sense to pay extra for federal student loans Debt to income ratio is based on monthly student loan payments not the total debt amount. If your monthly payment is $0, they use like 0.5% of your total balance as your monthly payment. So for $250k of loans, the lender calculated that my monthly payment is $1250 for their calculation of DTI. If your monthly payment is not $0, they just use their monthly payment amount to calculate DTI.Qualified for $650k mortgage with $250k income and $250k student loans",did quick calculation really doe confer real substantial benefit group compared existing idr plan basically make lower income bracket high debt pay loan high income low debt people benefitted idr plan place mid income mid debt people group benefit marginal quick calculation legislation deterrence borrowing people engage moral hazard borrowing ask people loan plan make year life just happens doe planned example debt income paying year making debt paying year kid forgiving unlike existing idr plan payment lower just make overall payment similarly hsa contribution confer benefit reduced payment need later life added existing clarify salary adjustable feel free edit spreadsheet making copy understand forgiving having standard plan buts actually forgiving existing idr plan literally giving student loan advice internet year half communicate information year old brother manner sufficient change mind social pressure college certain college outweigh rational especially teenager argue legal age signed contract underwriter loan enter contract real solution finding way bring cost education infinitely possible form plan equally fair chose discretionary income discretionary income used year amortization period standard purpose did choose variation fair uncommon grandfather legally changed including constitution matter probability possibility unlikely current plan impossible wage garnished higher income percent idr plan discretionary income reduction education training different job really require heavy education say education sufficient people generally funded property tax law degree practice law little changed practice went straight job year law school job use education grade way good employee grade score hard signal employer rely just training hand generally footed employer difficult job employment loss month inefficient likely prone error additionally person training job plus train dems issue republican responded opposing dem attempt address issue implemented save save poverty guideline multiplier subsidy compared multiplier subsidy repaye save generous plan low income borrower save enacted similarly paye repaye litigation save enacted paye repaye came threat passed process agreed runaway student loan debt ii lack access shift treasury payment wealthy working class regressive doe confer benefit hyper wealthy tax perspective federal taxation insolvency exception described post recently responded comment additionally student loan forgiveness exempt federal level taxation end congress decide extend exemption let lapse loan debt forgiveness general taxable long time law new mean minor concern just pay income based repayment focus investing paying mortgage literally priority reduced income decrease government ca foreclose degree maxed year typically doe make sense pay extra federal student loan debt income ratio based monthly student loan payment total debt monthly payment use like total balance monthly payment loan lender calculated monthly payment calculation dti monthly payment just use monthly payment calculate dti qualified mortgage income student loan,428
mlotto7,"My oldest daughter is 20 and just graduated with honors w/ a BS degree debt free.I am from poverty and have a BS and MA and did so debt free.My wife earned a BS and MS and did so debt free.My youngest daughter will earn an AA then go on to trade school - debt free.It's too easy for students to take out massive loans to float a work-free college experience where they eat and travel on loan money. It saddles them in debt for life and isn't necessary. Being from poverty, I am living proof higher education can be accomplished without debt if someone really tries. My family and I are alum from a lot of different schools:University of Oregon (Go Ducks!), Liberty, University of Utah (Go Utes!), University of the Southwest, University of Cumberlands, Arizona State University I'm from poverty and neither of my parents went to college. I knew if I wanted a shot at college (and needed my teeth desperately fixed) I had to join the military. At 18 I enlisted during wartime. Served honorably. Upon discharge I utilized my GI Bill and worked at Target from 12am-8am and attended class FT during the day. Yeah, I went without sleep sometimes but for me it was worth not having any debt. This is how I earned my undergrad. During graduate school I was a laboratory manager working 50 hours a week, married with two kids, took foster/adoption classes at night 2x a week to get state licensed as a foster parent so we could adopt, coached youth sports and never missed my daughter's soccer games and practices. Yeah...again...not much sleep but it sure beat going into debt or missing my family. I graduated with honors both under and grad school.My wife is from a well-off family and her parents paid her tuition but she was responsible for her insurance, gas, entertainment, books, fees. She had a partial scholarship as a cheerleader and paid her way by waitressing the same job for almost three years. She graduated at age 20 with honors - taking avg 18 credits and working.I wanted better for my kids so when they were born I invested $1000 into a 529 and also put $50 a month into them. My daughter did dual enrollment and graduated HS with her AA and stayed at home (no reason to live in dorms and pay $$). We used her fund for tuition. She will go on to a masters and she has enough in her fund to cover that too.My youngest wants to experience the dorm/college life and that's fine by me. We will help her financially and she has her college fund. She plans to just get an AA then go to trade school (court reporting). Living at home is the best scenario. I know that isn't healthy in some situations, but if a student can do it - it's best for the budget.Also, there are some amazing employers out there that offer tuition reimbursement for employees (even part time). Chipotle, Starbucks, and Amazon come to mind. I think I even saw Walmart. I was chatting with a young college student and employee of Chipotle a few weeks ago. She told me she loves her job, works part time, and gets about $5,500 in tuition support from the company. I believe (double-check) that Walmart employees get 100%. They are only for approved education programs - I believe anything from IT, healthcare, business, teaching - is included. Don't forget Pell Grant and to spend weeks (not a few hours) applying for any and all scholarships. Many of the smaller ones (say $500 a year) go unused because people aren't applying. I have a good friend who spent all summer just applying for scholarships of $500 or less and fully funded his degree.

mxzf,"Then they charge all the little extras fees like ""tech"" even though I am the one taking the class online ...I mean, ""tech"" is what's hosting the online class and providing the backbone for the teacher to actually use for an online class (software, hardware, tech support, etc). Of all of the things, a ""tech"" line-item in an online class makes total sense. It would be more understandable if you were complaining about a gym fee or something for an online class. Because the university is just expanding to fill a vacuum, that's the natural behavior of an organization. It's not ideal, but it's not shocking that an organization would want to accept as much money as banks are willing to throw at them when offered. with people who are just as skilledHaving attended both community college and a university, there isn't parity between them for everything.There are absolutely subjects where you can get a fine education from a community college, but they're not totally interchangeable with universities when it comes to complex topics. It depends on how the school budget is laid out. It quickly gets complicated when you've got five different departments with different budget codes working on different things.Generally speaking, at a university ""a professor teaching an online class"" is going to have involvement from the professor themselves, their college within the university, potentially their college's internal IT, the university IT, the university admissions department, and any other stuff like GRAs for the class or whatever. And that's just from the student's side. On the professor's side there's college and university people involved for payroll, benefits, facilities, and various other stuff. And each of those different departments handles things differently. It wouldn't be shocking to have some aspect of university IT outside the normal billing and handling things with a fee that changes depending on if it's an online class vs an in-person one or whatever. There's a feedback loop. One aspect of ""the quality of students those schools churn out"", from the perspective of people comparing one school with another, is the quality of research papers that the university produces. Because undergrad educations aren't everything, grad school and PhD programs are also a thing, and they tend to be easier to differentiate than undergrads that are churned out. No, that's the fundamental aspiration of science. Research for the sake of research is what science is all about; just learning new things about the universe and seeing what they mean and can be used for. There are times when you're trying to work towards something specific, but a lot of great innovations have come from either undirected research or research attempting to work on another topic and accidentally developing a different application. It's one of those things that varies wildly. I did all of my foreign language and English credits (and a couple other minor things) at a community college to reduce the cost and load of filling those same requirements at the university I went to. I had some classes at CC where the professor was serious and expected decent work from the class, but I also had others where the professor clearly cared less about the class than the students did and was just clocking in to get their paycheck. University professors seemed less variable. Yeah, that's the kind of financial illiteracy that kills people. You can't *actually* afford to pay the minimum payment on a loan, you'll be paying it off for forever. The minimum payment is for ""crap, I had a super bad month and finances are tight""; you need to be paying down the principle of the loan in general. Depends on where they moved to and what financial treaties that country has with the US regarding outstanding debt. Some countries might even refuse to let you move there at all if they suspect you're just moving to try and evade debt (that sort of person isn't generally the kind of person that countries want to recruit). So, you could probably get away with it if you're moving to Somalia or whatever, but much of western Europe would probably garnish your wages for the loans if they got a court-order for doing so from the US.",charge little extra fee like tech taking class online mean tech hosting online class providing backbone teacher actually use online class software hardware tech support thing tech line item online class make total sense understandable complaining gym fee online class university just expanding vacuum natural behavior organization ideal shocking organization want accept money bank willing throw offered people just skilledhaving attended community college university parity absolutely subject fine education community college totally interchangeable university come complex topic depends school budget laid quickly get complicated got different department different budget code working different thing generally speaking university professor teaching online class going involvement professor college university potentially college internal university university admission department stuff like gras class just student professor college university people involved payroll benefit facility various stuff different department handle thing differently shocking aspect university outside normal billing handling thing fee change depending online class v person feedback loop aspect quality student school churn perspective people comparing school quality research paper university produce undergrad education grad school phd program thing tend easier differentiate undergrad churned fundamental aspiration science research sake research science just learning new thing universe seeing mean used time trying work specific lot great innovation come undirected research research attempting work topic accidentally developing different application thing varies wildly did foreign language english credit couple minor thing community college reduce cost load filling requirement university went class cc professor expected decent work class professor clearly cared class student did just clocking paycheck university professor variable yeah kind financial illiteracy kill people ca actually afford pay minimum payment loan paying forever minimum payment crap super bad month finance tight need paying principle loan general depends moved financial treaty country regarding outstanding debt country refuse let suspect just moving try evade debt sort person generally kind person country want recruit probably away moving somalia western europe probably garnish wage loan got court order doing,315
random-bot-2,"I used to work in financial aid, and transitioned into some public policy work. I'll put my thoughts on this and avoid any doomsday predicting.SAVE is on the chopping block, probably will not make it, but IDR and PSLF will remain. Even if congress tries to make changes, I imagine it would just be for new applicants. Most of us in it would be grandfathered in, and can continue to the 120.The department of Ed will remain, it is possible funding gets cut which could impact things such as Pell. This will suck, but schools will adjust. They will most likely do layoffs to get tuition back down to a level students can handle if grants are decreased. Not great, but not the end of the world.The loan programs will also stay. Even if there is a change, it will happen over time. At worst it would be phased out like Perkins loans.My honest speculation is very little will change for most of the department of Ed/student loans besides the save plan. Most of the doom and gloom you read on this subreddit will not happen, as typically happens when people spew doomsday rhetoric. I believe sometime in 2025 you will get to respond to this comment saying you're final done. Cheers, friend I was actually in a financial aid conference around 2020 that had sections about this issues. This does not absolve DeVos of anything, but here was some insight I got from that. Most of those applications were being denied from the lenders on technicalities, which in the letter of the law was correct. You need to be in specific plans in order to qualify for the PSLF, many of the applicants were not. This led to congress simplifying, and offering expanded qualification. This was in 2018, while trump was president. Much of the program has been simplified now, and they have, and still are, phasing out problematic loan lenders who were responsible. This was less a trump move, and more of a few bad apples on top of some confusing rules.I can see blaming him as a simple way to view this, but from my perspective the situation was much more complex than that. It has since had positive changes to prevent it in the future. Both presidents have had a hand in improving this I can understand your stress. I have a little one on the way, and need every dollar possible. 7 years in, working in public sector is not great for the bank account, but is worth it once I get the 120. Just keep in mind he did not change the plans when he was previously president, and the department of Ed/loans seem low on his list of things to do. I believe in 26/27 you'll be celebrating your kid turning 3 and being student loan free. I do agree with that aspect. What I believe is likely to happen is congress will make the program a little more restricted on who can get access, and officially add it. I don't think it just completely goes away because so many people have already gotten on to it. It runs the risk of economic impact and republicans are promising a strong economy for all. So I can't imagine they'll do something that could directly hurt that especially so soon into their terms, but politicians are idiots sometimes lol As someone who suffers from panic attacks, I am so glad to hear this. They are the worst. Hopefully the starts a more peaceful day/week for you Right, talking about changes to these things has seemed more of a talking point rather than political action for several years now. Just a cheap way to get some undecided people to side with you.I have hope for the SAVE, I actually thinks it's incredibly beneficial, and I think taking it away after running it for almost a year is going to create a lot of legal issues. But I can also see it going. Fingers crossed for all of us it stays I believe everything is safe but the SAVE plan. If I were to even bet on that, I bet it stays, but I still wouldn't be surprised if it goes. The way the idr plans were brought about would require a lot more than just a change of president to be taken away. You should look into how the IDR plans were introduced. Something brought through congressional legislation isn't so easily removed That's still apart of the IDR plans, and I truly don't believe there will be any changes to those programs. It is important to know that if you do get the forgiveness that way, it is considered taxable income. Obviously a long ways away, but you should consider keeping money aside for a potential tax bill.Take this with a grain of salt. I realized after a few comments I wasn't well-versed on the 20 year program, so I've started to read into it today Absolutely! Loans and elections are stressful enough.

robotlasagna,"PPP is a loan that can be forgiven under specific guidelines If the business does not conform to those guidelines they have to pay back the loan.Student loans were never designed to be forgiven under ~~any~~ most circumstances.Edit: There are some rare exceptions for student loan discharge but by design the program was made to minimize the lender risk of loss because otherwise they would never lend to students (the absolute highest risk borrowers) or they would only lend at exorbitantly high interest rates (39%). If they are adjustable rate loans then yes they are! (Federal student loans are fixed rate.)If what you are asking is if specific types of student loans are designed to be predatory then again the answer is yes!Now I absolutely understand that it sucks to be saddled with student debt/education that you may have overpaid for but that's not an acceptable reason to forgive these loans. The reason for that is that it creates risk for anyone that issues debt if they believe a future administration might cancel that debt. The result is that companies, homeowners, small business owners stop getting loans which then causes the economy to falter.However there is no fundamental reason why congress cannot make a student whole by simply issuing a another loan with forgiveness provisions to the student which the student then uses to pay off the original loan. As long as the student follows the provisions of the program that gets forgiven and the student is out of debt. The government could attach some basic provisions that are good for society in general like: apply for the loan program, get the loan, pay off the original loan, do X hours of community service per $1000 borrowed cleaning up parks or streets or whatever and upon completion the program the loan is forgiven. The community wins, the student wins, they get out of debt and they pay a small price of helping the community. Yes its tough because the whole reason for making student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy was not some malicious thing but rather to make higher education as widely available as possible to everyone. The problem is that the borrowers, teenagers are \*literally\* the highest risk group for default. No rational lender would lend large amounts to teenagers unless the interest rates were very high to offset the default risk. But with the non-dischargeable provision the risk of default is far lower and the risk of non payment is virtually eliminated. The fact is that almost all student loans get paid off eventually which means borrowers could offer very low rates to students.Now that I'm a full grown adult I realize that is naive and stupid but that's what we fully believed at 18, and I think that's a part of this too.This is the predatory part. What economists understood but politicians didn't (or didn't want to hear) was that all this cheap money chasing education would result in massive tuition inflation and also things like ""video game design school"" or any of the other terrible for-profit bogus college programs. The government did own up to its lack of oversight of the kinds of schools it allowed to use the program and they have corrected that by removing them from the student loan program but we are still left with the current situation where tuitions are prohibitively high even at proper schools. The market will eventually correct itself but there will definitely be more pain in the interim. I always tell people in these conversations; It stops getting more expensive when people stop paying more.",ppp loan forgiven specific guideline business doe conform guideline pay loan student loan designed forgiven circumstance edit rare exception student loan discharge design program minimize lender risk loss lend student absolute highest risk borrower lend exorbitantly high rate adjustable rate loan yes federal student loan fixed rate asking specific type student loan designed predatory answer yes absolutely understand suck saddled student debt education overpaid acceptable reason forgive loan reason creates risk issue debt believe future administration cancel debt result company homeowner small business owner stop getting loan cause economy falter fundamental reason congress make student simply issuing loan forgiveness provision student student us pay original loan long student follows provision program get forgiven student debt government attach basic provision good society general like apply loan program loan pay original loan hour community service borrowed cleaning park street completion program loan forgiven community win student win debt pay small price helping community yes tough reason making student loan non dischargeable bankruptcy malicious thing make higher education widely available possible problem borrower teenager literally highest risk group default rational lender lend large amount teenager unless rate high offset default risk non dischargeable provision risk default far lower risk non payment virtually eliminated fact student loan paid eventually mean borrower offer low rate student grown adult realize naive stupid fully believed think predatory economist understood politician did did want hear cheap money chasing education result massive tuition inflation thing like video game design school terrible profit bogus college program government did lack oversight kind school allowed use program corrected removing student loan program left current situation tuition prohibitively high proper school market eventually correct definitely pain interim tell people conversation stop getting expensive people stop paying,283
snoopyvibes,"I have about $19k in student loans (if you include interest, principal balance is under $18.8k). I want to start making additional payments on them to get rid of them quicker. I hate having them linger and can financially afford additional payments. I do have 2 savings accounts - one for vacations/fun things and the other has enough to cover an emergency fund + savings for eventually a down payment on a house. Even with the additional payments, I am able to put money into savings still monthly. Whenever I mention wanting to pay student loans off quicker, everyone lectures me about it being a poor financial decision. They keep saying the US government will forgive loan balances and I'm basically throwing money away. My main intent on paying them off is it's my only debt left and I want to lower my debt to income ratio for a future mortgage. My question is - am I stupid for paying them off? I've lowered my balance already by $2k this year. It's an alarming number of people in my life who keep saying to stop making extra payments so I want to hear other opinions. Thanks! Yeah, I think I'm falling into the second bucket where I hate owing money. I paid my car off 2 years early because I had extra money. It was honestly stressing me out! That makes me feel better. They probably won't be paid off for another 2-3 years, but I'm hoping to throw any additional funds towards the principal of the loans. Makes sense - I am putting like 13% of my paycheck into my 401k with a 5% company match. It's auto increasing in a month or so, so I'm not terribly concerned. I think honestly my friends/family are more concerned that I've cut back on the ""fun"" things I used to buy. I still splurge a little with an occasional LEGO set or booking a vacation, but I have been cracking down a little bit. I'm still enjoying every day, so I'm not concerned. I think it's an outside perspective where instead of me buying 10 books from Barnes & noble, I'm using the library, and they think my life is ""sad"" now. Unfortunately, based on income the SAVE plan wouldn't make much sense for me. I make a little over $70k. I talked it through with my loan provider and they recommended a different plan for me to go through. My lowest interest rate is 3.5% and the bulk of them are 4.2%. Yesss that's what I'm hoping! I want to buy probably in like 2 years so I really want to lower my debt. My parents also very kindly helped me out with some college expenses so I'd love to pay mine off and then help pay their parent loan they took out for me. It's around $8k but I still feel guilty about it! That's a good thought process! I'm paying right around the same. I want them gone honestly. Yeah, was bummed to see the $10k off the table! At the time with interest frozen, I only had $18k in loans. If I had $8k left after the forgiveness, I was just going to take money from savings and pay it off. Oh well, guess I'll keep making the large payments and seeing what happens! I have 2 loans of 4.04%, 2 loans that are 4.2%, and 2 that are 3.51%. I've spending my energy on the ones with 4.2% interest I have 2 loans of 4.04%, 2 loans that are 4.2%, and 2 that are 3.51%. I've spending my energy on the ones with 4.2% interest Thanks for the recommendation! I've been trying to do something similar - I started a high yield savings account specifically for paying off loans.

throwawtphone,"I bet most people dont even know anything about the debt forgiveness programs. They dont even know what they are fighting against.Biden-Harris Administration Approves Additional $4.28 Billion in Student Debt Relief for Nearly 55,000 Public Service WorkersLatest action brings approved relief to almost $180 billion for 4.9 million borrowersThe Biden-Harris Administration announced today the approval of $4.28 billion in additional student loan relief for 54,900 borrowers across the country who work in public service. This relief--which is the result of significant fixes that the Administration has made to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program--brings the total loan forgiveness by the Administration to approximately $180 billion for nearly five million Americans, including $78 billion for 1,062,870 borrowers through PSLF. ""Four years ago, the Biden-Harris Administration made a pledge to America's teachers, service members, nurses, first responders, and other public servants that we would fix the broken Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and I'm proud to say that we delivered,"" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. ""With the approval of another $4.28 billion in loan forgiveness for nearly 55,000 public servants, the Administration has secured nearly $180 billion in life-changing student debt relief for nearly five million borrowers. The U.S. Department of Education's successful transformation of the PSLF Program is a testament to what's possible when you have leaders, like President Biden and Vice President Harris, who are relentlessly and unapologetically focused on making government deliver for everyday working people."" The PSLF Program provides an incentive for Americans to pursue and remain in careers in education, public health, law enforcement, emergency response, and other critical public service fields by forgiving borrowers' remaining student loan balance after they have made the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. The relief announced today includes both borrowers who have benefitted from the Administration's limited PSLF waiver, a temporary opportunity that ended in October 2022, as well as from regulatory improvements made to the program during this Administration. In addition to these fixes to PSLF, the Biden-Harris Administration also implemented further improvements to PSLF to make it easier for borrowers to participate in the program. As of July 2024, the PSLF Program is now fully managed by the Department via StudentAid.gov, rather than by a single loan servicer, making it easier for borrowers to track their progress toward forgiveness. An Unparalleled Record of Support for Federal Student Loan Borrowers Since day one, the Biden-Harris Administration has been committed to helping borrowers who have struggled with the burden of student loan debt. Over the past four years, the Administration has approved nearly $180 billion in student debt relief for 4.9 million borrowers through various actions, taking historic steps to aid hardworking Americans across the country who have worked to repay their student loans but remained in debt. In total, the Biden-Harris Administration has also approved:$56.5 billion for more than 1.4 million borrowers through Income-Driven Repayment, including the Saving on a Valuable Education SAVE plan. This includes administrative adjustments to income-driven repayment that brought borrowers closer to forgiveness and addressed longstanding problems due to past inaccuracies and the misuse of forbearance by loan servicers. $28.7 billion for more than 1.6 million borrowers who were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions precipitously close, or are covered by related court settlements. $16.2 billion for almost 572,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.In addition to ensuring that student loans are not a barrier to educational and economic opportunity for students and families, the Administration also secured a $900 increase to the maximum Pell Grant--the largest increase in a decade--and finalized new rules to help protect borrowers from career programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debts and insufficient earnings.[source. this is debt forgiveness for people who are in shit paying jobs teaching kids, police, firefighters, nurses, doctors working for government ]( other public works people, road crew guy at DoT, and so on....",bet people dont know debt forgiveness program dont know fighting biden harris administration approves additional billion student debt relief nearly public service workerslatest action brings approved relief billion million borrowersthe biden harris administration announced today approval billion additional student loan relief borrower country work public service relief result significant fix administration public service loan forgiveness pslf program brings total loan forgiveness administration approximately billion nearly million american including billion borrower pslf year ago biden harris administration pledge america teacher service member nurse responder public servant fix broken public service loan forgiveness program proud say delivered said secretary education miguel cardona approval billion loan forgiveness nearly public servant administration secured nearly billion life changing student debt relief nearly million borrower department education successful transformation pslf program testament possible leader like president biden vice president harris relentlessly unapologetically focused making government deliver everyday working people pslf program provides incentive american pursue remain career education public health law enforcement emergency response critical public service field forgiving borrower remaining student loan balance required qualifying monthly payment relief announced today includes borrower benefitted administration limited pslf waiver temporary opportunity ended october regulatory improvement program administration addition fix pslf biden harris administration implemented improvement pslf make easier borrower participate program july pslf program fully managed department studentaid gov single loan servicer making easier borrower track progress forgiveness unparalleled record support federal student loan borrower day biden harris administration committed helping borrower struggled burden student loan debt past year administration approved nearly billion student debt relief million borrower various action taking historic step aid hardworking american country worked repay student loan remained debt total biden harris administration approved billion million borrower income driven repayment including saving valuable education save plan includes administrative adjustment income driven repayment brought borrower closer forgiveness addressed longstanding problem past inaccuracy misuse forbearance loan servicers billion million borrower cheated school saw institution precipitously close covered related court settlement billion borrower total permanent disability addition ensuring student loan barrier educational economic opportunity student family administration secured increase maximum pell grant largest increase decade finalized new rule help protect borrower career program leave graduate unaffordable debt insufficient earnings source debt forgiveness people shit paying job teaching kid police firefighter nurse doctor working government public work people road crew guy dot,375
tizuby,"""They"" can't do that, so no.The debt holder is the Department of Education for student loans (excepting the \~3% of old-style student loans that are still outstanding) and it cannot sell the debt off.The thing you're describing doesn't exist for government student loans (which is around 95% of all student loans).Private student loans do still exist in a very small amount, but are an insignificant amount of loans (it's like 2-3%) and aren't really governed by student loan law for the most part. Dude most people in here don't even seem to understand that student loans are almost entirely issued and held by the Department of Education itself (the student loan program did away with banks issuing loans over a decade ago).They just have strong opinions on things they know like nothing about. It's fucking wild looking at all of these long comment chains of misinformation piling on misinformation. SLABS have nothing to do with anything. They're all but extinct at this point.\~95% of student loan debt is issued and held by the Department of Education, which is not and cannot be engaged in the practice.It used to be a thing, it mostly ended after 2010 when the way government student loans were issued changed. no it fucking wouldn'tIt actually would because MOHELA gets a percentage of the ongoing payments of the loans they service. Loan accounts go down, MOHELA nets less money. It's why they have standing. The ""harm"" to MOHELA in debt forgiveness is wiping out most of its income.it was established in multiple levels of the judiciary that MOHELA doesn't have any actual connection to student loansNo it wasn't. Literally the opposite. MOHELA has standing. That's how the original debt forgiveness plan got done away with, via MOHELA. It's consistently had standing since it's a loan servicer. Every loan servicer has standing. **The Biden admin** 2 years ago agreed MOHELA has standing. The courts consistently said MOHELA has standing and basically no one argued that it did not.The controversial issue around standing was whether the *S****tate of Missouri***, which owns MOHELA could, in its role as owner of MOHELA, sue on MOHELA's behalf even if MOHELA itself didn't want to sue. The Biden admin contended they were an independent organization.The courts ultimately said ""Yeah, they can do that. They own it, it was created by legislation. It is not independent of the state."" That one is still a bit controversial but not legally unsound. the SCOTUS ruled in 2024 that a conservative president's official acts can't be subjected to legal scrutiny.They absolutely did not do that. Christ read an article about what it actually did or something. This is about as factually incorrect as one can get.They ruled POTUS cannot be *criminally* prosecuted for constitutionally valid official acts (to be determined by the court) and has a presumptive immunity from *criminal* prosecution for congressionally granted official acts (prosecutor has to show it's more likely than not that said act is not within the bounds of what congress authorized).It in no way, shape, or form affects judicial review/legal scrutiny over the administrative branch. For fucks sake. That situation would still have nothing to do with Trump v. U.S. so isn't at all relevant to correcting the false claim that said case nixed review. You're goalposts are moving so fast they're on fucking wheels dude.Consider taking some time off reddit, going outside, and breathing some air.",ca debt holder department education student loan excepting old style student loan outstanding sell debt thing describing doe exist government student loan student loan private student loan exist small insignificant loan like really governed student loan law dude people understand student loan entirely issued held department education student loan program did away bank issuing loan decade ago just strong opinion thing know like fucking wild looking long comment chain misinformation piling misinformation slab extinct point student loan debt issued held department education engaged practice used thing ended way government student loan issued changed fucking wouldn tit actually mohela get percentage ongoing payment loan service loan account mohela net money standing harm mohela debt forgiveness wiping income established multiple level judiciary mohela doe actual connection student loansno literally opposite mohela standing original debt forgiveness plan got away mohela consistently standing loan servicer loan servicer standing biden admin year ago agreed mohela standing court consistently said mohela standing basically argued did controversial issue standing tate missouri owns mohela role owner mohela sue mohela behalf mohela did want sue biden admin contended independent organization court ultimately said yeah created legislation independent state bit controversial legally unsound scotus ruled conservative president official act ca subjected legal scrutiny absolutely did christ read article actually did factually incorrect ruled potus criminally prosecuted constitutionally valid official act determined court presumptive immunity criminal prosecution congressionally granted official act prosecutor likely said act bound congress authorized way shape form affect judicial review legal scrutiny administrative branch fuck sake situation trump relevant correcting false claim said case nixed review goalpost moving fast fucking wheel dude consider taking time reddit going outside breathing air,273
urLocalpoopstain,"As the title said. I'm not paying a cent on my student loans. I don't work in my fieldEven if I did I wouldn't be able to find a job good enough to pay them back on top of my other expensesI regret getting my degree. I'm in love with it. I love the field. It's graphic and web and an MFA for my graduates program. Aced everything got a 3.8-4.0 GPA. This program made me genuinely happy. I freelance a lot and make a lot of money from that but it's enough for my expenses. I've applied to 9-5's all over but they literally pay minimum -ish wage and require bachelor's degrees. Like.....wtfHow does that make any sense? I'm guessing the worse that can happen is the payments defaulting but...there's nothing I can do I just don't have the money. It's either pay back worthless loans or eat and have shelter.Edit: Thank you for the suggestions and resources. I'm eligible for forgiveness since my school closed down and failed to give me resources after I graduated. I'm gonna go for an income based repayment plan. For those of you telling me I need to ""act like an adult"" without giving me any tips or resources you're not helpful and I see you only like typing for the sake of it. As you can see I'm frustrated about my situation which is an issue that millions of people have so I want you to look at these millions of people with the same energy and tell them all to ""just be an adult"" and pay back unrealistic prices for education when we weren't even set for success to pay them back. How were we supposed to know that the job and housing market would change THIS drastically? How were we gonna know that we weren't going to afford Bread or eggs and rent even with a full time job? All I wanted was to be happy and now I'm paying an almost impossible debt just for having dreams.Doesn't that sound unreasonably horrible to you? No one is co signed for me. And instead of not paying I'm gonna go for the income based repayment plan. They are. So I'll try for this. I think it stated that o had that option I thought america could still tax you even if you move away (idk if that's true, correct me if it isnt) This is probably a way better option than me being a salty bitch What L take. I see the value of a house before purchasing it. And I can sell the house if I don't want it. Eventhough I may or may not get that same value back from selling it, it's a tangible asset that will always be in profit since people need homes. You pay for an inspector you have garuntees that the home would be worth its price and if it isn't I can physically look at a home and TELL if it will benifet me or not. At this moment I was taken advantage of fresh out of high school with false ambitions. It's as if a badly influenced decision I made when I was a M I N O R shouldn't fuck me THIS HARD. Not at all especially since most Jon's REQUIRE a bachelor's and payed minimum wage. ""A lot"" in terms of being able to pay for my expenses. Which is A LOT for freelancing alone. Usually people can't even make equivalent to minimum wage freelancing. I can cover my current expenses and be able to afford food and shelter in the current market so yes ..it's a lot. And I've already been doing that. I do it all the time. You're right. I need to do more research on it and base prices over everything including cost of living. Good for you though man, contracting is tough work. I'm going through a carpentry class now and I'm only in the neginning of the HVAC course and it's already a doozy but I'm enjoying it. Old, I'll go with this. I'll just call before they start the payments in April. I'm eligible for the income based repayment plan and I may be able to apply for forgiveness based on the comments so ill do that. Ok* not ""Old"". Thanks autocorrect you made me sound like an asshole. My school is listed on here holy shit OMG, THANK YOU SO MUCH! I just read through the information on the site, and now I can call my loan representative to walk me through the process! I'm eligible since my school closed right after graduation. So I wasn't given any career resources that I was promised. They also charged us for housing that we didn't have. I was talking to my bestie about it, and she's gonna do the same. I have social security? These are facts. I guess unless I ""freelance"" for a firm or something (i think). But that's not the case for me. The degree type doesn't matter. I still learned a lot in the field that I still love. Idk why you're using this post to bash my field of choice. If I chose anything else I'd fail because I wouldn't be happy. So clearly this is an issue for a lot of people on this sub, if you don't have any facts or value to add to the conversation then why reply and comment?

waterwicca,"Sounds like you are on the SAVE plan, which is currently being challenged in the courts. Everyone on SAVE has been put in forbearance while the courts battle it out. Your idr was set to end (you would need to recertify in December to keep it) but they have pushed back all the recertifications by a year because of the court drama so you don't have to recertify until December 2025 now. But keep an eye on this sub for court updates in the next few months. They are likely to get rid of the SAVE plan and you may need to take action when they do. There are a few IDR plans right now (although they are not processing applications because of the court limbo as of now). Mostly people are assuming that the only safe one in the end will be ""IBR"" because of how it was legally made. It's all just speculation, though. People are not optimistic with Trump's administrations plans coming up fast. But really we just have to wait and see what the courts say first. It's just a waiting game right now. If you feel like doing some reading to get an idea about what's being going on with the court stuff:[This is a post that has been tracking the progress of the litigation.]( post is one of the most recent updates with a good forbes article on different idr options and their potential future.]( this post is addressing the changing dates on Idr recertifications.]( to add: [this is a page to learn about the different idr options as they exist right now]( If you're on the interest free ""stop save"" forbearance then they say that any payments will ""go towards satisfying future payments when payments resume"". So supposedly you can give your servicer money and they will just sort of hold onto it and apply it accordingly later on when the forbearance ends. No one really knows what that looks like. A lot of people have chosen instead to set aside the money they would normally use to make payments and put it somewhere like a high yield savings account so that money can work for you and earn some interest for you while you wait for the end of the forbearance. Then you can take that money out and work on paying your loans again when payments resume. As of right now no one will be accepted onto SAVE. They aren't processing applications at all right now. Supposedly they are accepting them and they are sitting there, but nothing will actually be done yet. They are supposed to start processing apps again in mid December. Not sure what that will exactly look like. People trying to move to anything but SAVE will probably get processed slowly but surely, but the SAVE apps might just sit in processing limbo while the courts figure it out. Make sure to keep a close eye on your email and loan accounts. This is just a guess, but unless the courts make a decision quickly, those in SAVE and applying to SAVE might sit on forbearance until there is a decision. Whether or not that's a good thing or not is up to you. When they do start processing applications, you should have the choice to choose a different IDR plan other than SAVE, but, just as a note of caution, some are worried other idr plans may run into legal challenges as well. Right now SAVE is the only one directly being challenged and probably thrown away, but make sure you stay on top of the news here in case anything else happens in the coming months.",sound like save plan currently challenged court save forbearance court battle idr set end need recertify december pushed recertifications year court drama recertify december eye sub court update month likely rid save plan need action idr plan right processing application court limbo people assuming safe end ibr legally just speculation people optimistic trump administration plan coming fast really just wait court say just waiting game right feel like doing reading idea going court stuff post tracking progress litigation post recent update good forbes article different idr option potential future post addressing changing date idr recertifications add page learn different idr option exist right free stop save forbearance say payment satisfying future payment payment resume supposedly servicer money just sort hold apply accordingly later forbearance end really know look like lot people chosen instead set aside money normally use make payment like high yield saving account money work earn wait end forbearance money work paying loan payment resume right accepted save processing application right supposedly accepting sitting actually supposed start processing apps mid december sure exactly look like people trying save probably processed slowly surely save apps just sit processing limbo court figure make sure close eye email loan account just guess unless court make decision quickly save applying save sit forbearance decision good thing start processing application choice choose different idr plan save just note caution worried idr plan run legal challenge right save directly challenged probably thrown away make sure stay news case happens coming month,247
wes7946,"The federal government largely nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 via a piece of legislation related to Obamacare, the ""Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010."" The US government now holds 92 percent of all student loans - and the nation's [total student debt]( has more than doubled, from $811 billion in April 2010 to $1.751 trillion.Part of the reason the figures have surged - and students start life so indebted - is due to income-based repayment policies that made it impossible for most people to ever pay off their student loans. In their haste to have the US taxpayer underwrite the maximum amount of college tuition, they transformed most student loans from a fixed-rate loan - like a mortgage or car loan - to a plan based on the student's post-graduation income. Gradually, the borrower's share of his college loans shrank, while the taxpayer's increased. These policies made student loan debt effectively permanent and unpayable.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) spelled out the process in[a thorough, February 2020 report]( CBO researchers followed college graduates who began paying off student loans in 2012. ""By the end of 2017, over 75% of those borrowers owed more than they had originally borrowed. By contrast, the median balance among borrowers in fixed-payment plans decreased steadily,"" they noted. ""Loans are often repaid more slowly under income-driven plans because the required payments are too small to cover the accruing interest. As a result, borrowers in such plans typically see their balance grow over time rather than being paid down.""The federal government took over nearly all student loans, forced students to make years of payments only to fall further behind, then handed the enlarged debt to the US taxpayer. To add insult to injury, the federal government also made it all-but impossible to discharge student loans in bankruptcy, ensuring that graduates' hopelessly accumulating loan payments went on endlessly - and that college administrators continued to collect.The majority of student loans are now income-based according to the CBO, and the loans the government would issue between 2020 and 2029 will cost taxpayers an estimated $82.9 billion. All this ignores the fact that Uncle Sam has proved a poor accountant. [A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report ]( released in July 2022 found the Department of Education predicted that student loans would generate $114 billion for the federal government; they instead lost $197 billion - [a $311 billion error]( mostly due to incorrect analysis.Is it possible that this is the next step for government-funded college? This is the result of an income-based repayment plan. The banks secretly, but not so secretly, want those with student loans to go on these types of plans knowing the payments will really only cover the accrued interest every month thereby creating a lifelong asset out of the borrower.",federal government largely nationalized student loan industry piece legislation related obamacare health care education reconciliation act government hold percent student loan nation total student debt doubled billion april trillion reason figure surged student start life indebted income based repayment policy impossible people pay student loan haste taxpayer underwrite maximum college tuition transformed student loan fixed rate loan like mortgage car loan plan based student post graduation income gradually borrower share college loan shrank taxpayer increased policy student loan debt effectively permanent unpayable congressional budget office cbo spelled process thorough february report cbo researcher followed college graduate began paying student loan end borrower owed originally borrowed contrast median balance borrower fixed payment plan decreased steadily noted loan repaid slowly income driven plan required payment small cover accruing result borrower plan typically balance grow time paid federal government took nearly student loan forced student make year payment fall handed enlarged debt taxpayer add insult injury federal government impossible discharge student loan bankruptcy ensuring graduate hopelessly accumulating loan payment went endlessly college administrator continued collect majority student loan income based according cbo loan government issue cost taxpayer estimated billion ignores fact uncle sam proved poor accountant government accountability office gao report released july department education predicted student loan generate billion federal government instead lost billion billion error incorrect analysis possible step government funded college result income based repayment plan bank secretly secretly want student loan type plan knowing payment really cover accrued month creating lifelong asset borrower,244
xantharia,"American institutions become extremely inefficient the moment government gets involved. eg building subways in the US is four times more expensive than in Paris; prescription drugs are way more expensive than elsewhere but non-prescription drugs are cheaper; military weapons are way more expensive than other countries yet civilian industrials are on-par, etc. And likewise American colleges were way more affordable (relative to median income) before the Department of Education started offering grants and loans. Government involvement simply removes the incentive for prospective students to factor price into their college choices, and they rewarded the colleges that have the highest inflation. Any college that tries to keep costs in check simply ends up with less government handouts and loans. eg Harvard's endowment is so big that they could easily eliminate all tuition. But instead they post a super-high ticket price while being generous with financial aid. This way they capture the deep pockets of government and private grants and loans while stressing the budgets of upper-middle-class parents, but reserving a free ride for low income students. But the posted ticket price is matched by all peer institutions making the entire market unaffordable for both upper-middle-class Americans and the taxpayers.The truth is that if college is too expensive for individual families to pay, then it's too expensive for the taxpayers to pay as well. If we want higher education to become more efficient and deliver a less expensive product we need to ban all government grants and loans. Let market forces reward colleges that supply better value. I wish I knew. Some hypotheses: Maybe US business is so expert at maximizing profit that any interaction with government bureaucrats results in profiteers running rings around them. Or maybe it relates to American tort laws and litigiousness -- e.g. how the California high speed rail inflated from \~$35 billion to now well over $100 billion, and it might never be completed. A significant fraction of that budget goes to lawyers -- e.g. the way that the rail path was decided before all the land was purchased, so the remaining land owners naturally knew that they could demand the sky given that the project has no choice but to buy their land.As an expat in Asia, I'm constantly astonished at how good public services are. e.g. the super-low-tax city of Hong Kong has a fantastic subway system that actually makes money. Or take Singapore that constantly grows its subway with low fares, yet this is a low-tax country (e.g. if you earn $100k you pay less than 5% in income tax) -- yet they buy the very best military jets, etc. Compare with New York City that has an expensive and money-losing antique subway system in a high tax state with its own high city taxes, high property tax, high sales tax, etc, and where train fares are super expensive. The bridges have been collecting huge fares for decades after decades. Where does all this money go??Simple example: During COVID, Singapore developed a smartphone app for contact tracing, to control access to public buildings, and to show proof of vaccination and PCR testing. It worked really well and the total budget was $7.5 million. Meanwhile New York City produced a similar app, but that was super buggy, offered fewer features, and ultimately was abandoned as a failure. The total budget for that failed product was $250 million, with a good chuck going to IBM. Why were Singapore's bureaucrats so much more efficient in contracting out their project?? I don't know.It's perhaps worth noting that the US wasn't always this way. The Hoover Dam was the wonder of the world back in the day, yet it was built ahead of schedule and under budget -- impossible to imagine today. Of course, by comparison to today's environmental rules, standards, and safety systems and regulations, those for Hoover Dam were almost nonexistent. Indeed, the fraction of budgets that go to administrative and regulatory compliance is massive today, and largely serviced by consultant companies and law firms that are famous for charging an arm and a leg by the hour. Consider that when San Fran wanted to create a new rapid transit bus route -- presumably to save on congestion and pollution -- the environmental review for the project took [13 years to complete]( and probably cost many millions of dollars. That's 13 years of extra congestion and pollution just to do the paperwork for the environmental impact assessment! Why didn't someone high up in city government simply say ""yeah, let's skip the 13 year environmental review and just call this transit project a net environmental benefit"" -- well probably because the environmental consultancy companies spend millions lobbying state government for more stringent and more complex regulations. Huh? Are you kidding? The private over-priced schools are the ones that fleece the government the most! They get the gravy both ways. I work in this business and I've seen how it works. e.g. The total cost of attendance for Harvard Medical School is about $110,000 x 4.5, or $495,000. So you're probably thinking ""yeah, but all those professor salaries are really high"" -- except that Harvard Medical School gives new junior faculty 3-4 years to get enough research funding to fully cover their own salaries, otherwise they won't get tenure and they'd be fired. This means that some 80% of the faculty have their salaries paid for not by the school but by the taxpayer, which amounts to between $200,000 and $400,000 per professor per year. And yet, despite having the taxpayer pay for most of Harvard Medical School's faculty salaries, they still charge half a million dollars to their students! Why do they do that? Because they can! Because loans are available to medical students to cover this. (Which means that when new doctors graduate, they're pressured to pursue expensive specializations so that they can repay these huge debts). Meanwhile, on every NIH grant awarded to a Harvard Medical School professor, the university takes an additional 70% in ""overhead"" -- supposedly to cover the costs of electricity, facilities, administrative management, etc. Meaning that if you got a $1,000,000 research grant from NIH, the university separately gets an additional $700,000 from the taxpayer. But if the grant money came from a private foundation, the university only takes some 20% to 30% in overhead. Why so much less? Doesn't electricity (etc) cost just as much? Well, it's simply because private foundations won't put up with exorbitant rates, while these universities have lobbyists in Washington to convince Congress to pay them exorbitant overhead rates.Suppose we look at Harvard Graduate Schools tuition rates for Ph.D. students:* Year 1: $55,656* Year 2: $55,656* Year 3: $14,470* Year 4: $14,470* Year 5+: $3,682In the sciences, you typically take 2-4 courses in the first two years, and after that you're only doing lab research (which isn't costing the university anything because research is sponsored by NSF or NIH). So are these 2-4 courses really worth $100k? And why is tuition $3,682 per year after your fourth year? Well, here's how it works: some students enter graduate school having been awarded a fellowship (e.g. NIH, NSF, DOD, Howard Hughes, etc) while other students don't have fellowships. For the second group, the university automatically waives their tuition for years 1-4. But they publish the official $140,252 rate for years 1-4 precisely so that they can charge this to the taxpayer via the fellowships. Why does it drop off so much after year 4? Because fellowships only pay for four years. The bottom line is that these are all funny numbers invented to charge as much as possible to the taxpayer, but once students are no longer covered then a more realistic rate of $3,682 kicks in (seeing as graduate students hardly cost anything because they're doing their own research and not taking classes). The bottom line is that the least efficient and most expensive schools get the most amount of federal money, either through loans and grants to students, or by making the taxpayer pay the professor's salaries, or by overcharging overhead rates, or by trying to charge federal fellowships as much as possible. Well, I think it's complicated. America clearly has some structural problems in law and governance that need to be fixed, and it's not just in government services. Plenty of private-sector services have managed to avoid anti-trust protections and end up being extremely inefficient. For example, I have purchased package bundles for ""home fibre internet + cable TV + fixed line + cell phone"" in Asia, Europe, and the US. In Asia I pay about $35 a month, in Europe I pay $45 a month. But in the US with Xfinity I pay around $230 per month. Why is there inadequate competition to bring down the price in the US? Probably because companies like AT&T, Comcast, etc., have managed to lobby politicians and regulators to avoid healthy competition. But I don't favor too much government inside or outside of the US. In general, government is less efficient than private companies -- that's just the nature of the beast. A private business prospers by maximizing revenue and minimizing costs, so it thrives on efficiency. Government services thrive on bloat. e.g. Biden's $7.5 billion investment in EV charging has only produced 7 stations in two years, while Tesla installs 350 stations every year for far less money.Our overall prosperity depends on the overall productivity of the economy in aggregate. If trucks can deliver food cheaper, then the food sold in stores is cheaper, and as a result you can purchase more food in return for each hour of your work -- which means that you are now more prosperous. If we imagine that the national economy is like a giant clock with zillions of cogs (each representing private and public services), the efficiency of the economy as a whole is measured by how much input energy it takes to ultimately move the hands of the clock. Less efficient cogs take more energy to spin, perhaps because they don't have enough oil. But they reduce overall productivity because everything is interconnected. If government services are responsible for a larger fraction of GDP, it means that overall the economy is less efficient and therefore overall there is less prosperity for everyone. We are seeing that in France right now, with government's fraction of the economy being above 55% of GDP, and as a result per-capita GDP for French people is falling. With each year the French actually get poorer. The US government's fraction was about 10% of GDP under FDR, and today it's around (I think) about 35%. So it's increasing, which is bad, but still small enough that the economy in aggregate is more efficient than the French economy. Of course government plays essential roles in any economic system -- e.g. to track and protect private property, to provide defense, to prevent monopolies, to regulate against negative externalities, and to avoid a ""tragedy of the commons"" by being responsible for common spaces. But we should always avoid allowing government to provide services where private businesses (in healthy competition) are more efficient. You call it the ""property-owning class"" but in a healthy market-driven economy, this includes almost everyone to some degree or another. It's easy to see why this is so important by looking at countries that lack solid property title systems: they stay mired in poverty. Much of Latin America and Africa have people living on land informally -- i.e. ask small farmers in Columbia or Guatemala, and many don't have titles to the lands that they use. A rich plantation company or mining concern with lots of lawyers and political influence can suddenly buy the land from the state, making the little farmers destitute. Without titles they cannot use their property as equity for a loan to buy a tractor, for example. Yet modern economies achieve incredible levels of productivity by making expensive investments that are only possible through a chain of loans based on various kinds of proven equity. Mexico has lots of informal houses that are built brick-by-brick over 10+ years because their ""owners"" have no basis to get a loan to build the house in one go. To build a house efficiently a building company needs a crane, but those easily cost $500,000 -- how can a small company buy this? Again, through a chain of titles, where, say, their existing fleet of pickup trucks and power tools can be used as equity for a new loan. Bottom line is that the efficient allocation of capital depends on tracking and defending property rights. Government's role in providing the legal infrastructure for defending property rights is essential. As I've mentioned separately, if competition cannot be assured, there are instances where we have no choice but to make the government responsible for such services. I find US health care so appallingly inefficient that I'd probably favor a single-payer solution as a last resort, i.e. Medicare for all where the government is the single-payer and thereby gets to dictate prices. The Japanese have a successful healthcare system of private insurance and private suppliers but with government-imposed caps on the cost of services (e.g. there's a massive database listing every medical procedure and this database dictates the maximum allowable charge for each service). Do Medicare bureaucrats have the capacity to do the same without being undermined by Congressmen influenced by lobbyists?Pharma prices are again where US government regulations seem to cause massive inefficiencies. The instant that a drug is designated ""prescription only"" means that various middlemen capitalize on government regulation to triple the price. Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company works to bypass this weirdly inefficient pharmaceutical supply chain and thereby manages to sell drugs without insurance discounts for \*less\* than what many Americans pay \*with\* their insurance discounts! Consider that the popular drug Ozempic costs about $150/month outside of the US (without any insurance or subsidies) but costs closer to $1,500/month in the US. Somehow the instant that the FDA designates a drug as ""prescription only,"" the effect of the special handling regulations on the supply chain is that the price jacks up by an order of magnitude. Americans should be able to buy Ozempic online from, say, Singapore, which would instantly drop the price by 90% -- but the FDA doesn't allow this. Bernie Sanders keeps blaming Novo Nordisk for the high price in the US without admitting that much of this premium is peculiar to the system of distribution under FDA's rules, and not the fault of Novo Nordisk. An essential component of all this is competition. A natural selection among businesses allows only the more efficient ones to survive because they get more clients by offering better value. With Soviet factories, the inefficient ones were awarded by Moscow bureaucrats with more investment and more manpower to help them improve their productivity. This creates an incentive for factories to be less efficient so that they can attract more investment. In the west, the inefficient factories lose investment because shareholders sell their stocks, and such companies ultimately go bankrupt. The result is that by the time of reunification, West Germany was incredibly richer, more productive, and less polluting than East Germany. So yes, we cannot allow an economy where there is only one trucking company. Some domains form natural monopolies, e.g. water utilities, in which case a government-run service may be better than a private monopoly. One common solution is for governments to issue time-limited concessions through open competition. Private companies offer bids to purchase concessions and the winner has a contractual agreement to supply x amount of water for y costs over z time period. These can work well, but they are tricky and require very smart government bureaucrats. You want the concessions to expire frequently enough to allow a more efficient company to win the next bid. But you don't want it to be too frequent or the companies won't be willing to invest in infrastructure for the long term. We've seen instances where the government auctioning of cellular bands as been very successful, and other instances where the government is hoodwinked by cellular companies conspiring illegally to divvy up the market so as to minimize competition (e.g. through secret codes hidden in their auction bids). Another natural monopoly is the rail system, seeing as few countries have spare land to build new railroads so the existing rail beds form natural monopolies. Countries shift back and forth between private and government run systems as neither is very satisfying in the long term. Currently EU rules are pressuring state rail companies to be privatized, whereas the UK is unhappy with its complex system of private rail companies and state-owned track, so the UK is now talking about re-nationalizing. The US has been very successful with a suite of private freight companies, but unsuccessful with Amtrak (technically private but effectively a government-run monopoly). The only successful high speed rail has been private, e.g. Brightline in Florida. State projects suffer because the longer that contractors delay completion, the more money they get from the state. Brightline is finishing projects at blazing speed in part because the longer it takes for them to complete a project, the more money they lose. An essential component of all this is competition. A natural selection among businesses allows only the more efficient ones to survive because they get more clients by offering better value.

Brightline is finishing projects at blazing speed in part because the longer it takes for them to complete a project, the more money they lose. The rare and weird world of US healthcare is the remarkable situation where economists predict that in theory it cannot work and in fact it doesn't work! Having an effective price cap by virtue of a single payer is something of a last resort to fix a broken system -- and even that may not work. e.g. if powerful labour unions win supplementary insurance for their members this would undermine the power of the single payer. I favor this only because the existing model is so shockingly bad. It's still very risky to have bureaucrats decide on prices because it's so hard for \*anyone\* to know what are the ""true"" prices of goods, services, and wages. Only a true free market provides these numbers automatically. There are lots of other possible models. For example, Germany, Switzerland, etc. have private insurance and private providers, but the interaction between the two is tightly regulated. In the US, the hospitals spend huge efforts overcharging the insurance (e.g. charging $50 per Tylenol pill!) while insurance companies spend equal efforts trying to minimize payouts. As a result, close to a third of healthcare costs are spent on medical administration alone. The tight regulation in Germany minimizes any wiggle-room between insurance and providers, which minimizes administrative overhead, and in the end the insurance companies mainly compete for patients based on how quickly and easily they reimburse them. A third model is what we see in Portugal where the insurance services and the hospital services belong to the same company. The companies compete for clients based on reputation and value, but otherwise costs are fairly well optimized. Another option that might work in the US is if (1) healthcare providers are not allowed to have different pricing for different insurance networks (2) healthcare providers must post all their rates (e.g. using machine-readable formats like RDF and detailed ontologies) (3) insurance companies are not allowed to cover 100% of costs, i.e. clients must pay some fraction of the bill up to a certain cutoff (e.g. 10%-30%, capped at $1000-$5000/year). (4) The highly granular published prices should allow AI to minimize administration and give insurance companies the ability to vary percent coverage depending on the provider. Various third-party AI-driven services inform patients what is the best value for money in their area for all combinations of insurance provider and healthcare provider. This would create an incentive for both healthcare providers and insurance companies to offer more efficient services because patients will make decisions based on value for money. e.g. Person A might be willing to pay $200 for a consultation with hardly any waiting time, while person B might prefer to pay $20 for a consultation with a longer waiting time. Typically the savings are passed on to the consumer. e.g. the profit margins for supermarkets are razor-thin because they compete neck-and-neck. If one supermarket manages to improve their efficiency they will try to attract more customers by offering lower prices. Some businesses offer unique products and charge a premium despite relegating themselves to a smaller market share -- e.g. Apple enjoys huge profit margins. But people can still buy Android phones at much lower cost from companies that compete on price and have thinner profit margins. Government-backed loans means that the treasury prints money with the promise that this debt is paid back with future labour. When you ""forgive"" loans, basically it means that you've printed money backed by zero labour. ie it's like printing counterfeit money. This is ""paid"" for through currency deflation, which is the same as inflation of goods and services. And inflation is the worst kind of tax because it hits lower income people disproportionately harder than upper income people. So you're making the non-college educated pay for the tuitions of the college educated. It's Robin Hood in reverse. It's ironic that the Dems lost the election because of the inflation caused by dumping $5 trillion of debt-financed COVID dollars onto the economy. And yet here Biden is still adding more to inflation by cancelling student debt.",american institution extremely inefficient moment government get involved building subway time expensive paris
