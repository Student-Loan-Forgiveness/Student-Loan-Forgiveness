Dude most people in here don't even seem to understand that student loans are almost entirely issued and held by the Department of Education itself (the student loan program did away with banks issuing loans over a decade ago).They just have strong opinions on things they know like nothing about. It's fucking wild looking at all of these long comment chains of misinformation piling on misinformation. SLABS have nothing to do with anything. They're all but extinct at this point.\~95% of student loan debt is issued and held by the Department of Education, which is not and cannot be engaged in the practice.It used to be a thing, it mostly ended after 2010 when the way government student loans were issued changed. no it fucking wouldn'tIt actually would because MOHELA gets a percentage of the ongoing payments of the loans they service. Loan accounts go down, MOHELA nets less money. It's why they have standing. The ""harm"" to MOHELA in debt forgiveness is wiping out most of its income.it was established in multiple levels of the judiciary that MOHELA doesn't have any actual connection to student loansNo it wasn't. Literally the opposite. MOHELA has standing. That's how the original debt forgiveness plan got done away with, via MOHELA. It's consistently had standing since it's a loan servicer. Every loan servicer has standing. **The Biden admin** 2 years ago agreed MOHELA has standing. The courts consistently said MOHELA has standing and basically no one argued that it did not.The controversial issue around standing was whether the *S****tate of Missouri***, which owns MOHELA could, in its role as owner of MOHELA, sue on MOHELA's behalf even if MOHELA itself didn't want to sue. The Biden admin contended they were an independent organization.The courts ultimately said ""Yeah, they can do that. They own it, it was created by legislation. It is not independent of the state."" That one is still a bit controversial but not legally unsound. the SCOTUS ruled in 2024 that a conservative president's official acts can't be subjected to legal scrutiny.They absolutely did not do that. Christ read an article about what it actually did or something. This is about as factually incorrect as one can get.They ruled POTUS cannot be *criminally* prosecuted for constitutionally valid official acts (to be determined by the court) and has a presumptive immunity from *criminal* prosecution for congressionally granted official acts (prosecutor has to show it's more likely than not that said act is not within the bounds of what congress authorized).It in no way, shape, or form affects judicial review/legal scrutiny over the administrative branch. For fucks sake. That situation would still have nothing to do with Trump v. U.S. so isn't at all relevant to correcting the false claim that said case nixed review. You're goalposts are moving so fast they're on fucking wheels dude.Consider taking some time off reddit, going outside, and breathing some air."
SD-777,1.0877470781549863,1.0,0.08774707815498628,Neutral,"Why does everyone downplay Biden's accomplishment here (FYI I'm no Biden super fan either). PSLF was willfully mismanaged for decades resulting in a near 99% rejection rate before Biden. Yes Biden is following the law, but who else has? This has been an inordinate amount of work for an underfunded Dept of Ed and Cardona is a Biden pick. Trump has already declared he is going to completely get rid of the Dept of Ed if he gets re-elected, let that sink in and think about what kind of oversight the lenders and servicers will have going forward. Sometimes just doing the minimum is heroic, certainly to those millions who put their faith in the government. Trust me, I know how ironic it is when we celebrate a president simply doing his job. I still believe he deserves the credit, again Cardona was his pick, he has also pushed forward student loan forgiveness outside of PSLF, in particular fighting against decades of willful mismanagement, forbearance steering, and forgiveness under disability, fraud, and even bankruptcy. He's taken the entire issue to SCOTUS, and is on schedule to see SCOTUS a 2nd time regarding his SAVE program. No, I don't believe he's ""just doing his job"" if you look at all the different ways he is actively attacking the issues over and above what is legislated, you can tell that he personally deeply believes in what he's doing, even though student loan forgiveness seems to be an unpopular political topic. Cue Betsy Devos version 2.0. So any legal minds have any idea what legal recourse there is to those who consolidated on the promise of forgiveness? Will we actually lose years of forgiveness and capitalize interest with zero recourse to sue the government?!? From what I understand, as a non-attorney, is that promissory estoppel is virtually impossible against the government. Which scenario is more likely?1) The dept of Ed actually gets out of Keystone Kops mode and updates the IDR counts. Biden forgives those in IBR before Jan 1st and fast tracks it through servicers to actually get done. (lol?)2) Those currently on SAVE are grandfathered into some sort of frankenstein SAVE plan, but slightly better than IBR. 3) Neither of the above happens (my money is on this) and we are just all screwed, especially the millions who consolidated on the advice of the dept of ed and Biden admin. We just lost years and years of forgiveness and capitalized lots and lots of interest for nothing. It's insane how ""fear-mongering"" quickly turned into reality. Best case scenario at this point is for the IDR adjustment to be finished by the end of the year and a switch back to IBR. My loans were up June 2024, right up to the wire, I will owe MORE taxes on forgiven loans than my original principal because of the consolidation (not even counting the payments I've already made the past 25 years) if they somehow don't get through before the tax moratorium ends. My question is WHY the heck are the IBR applications being held up?!?! There is a real chance for some to get forgiveness right away, but not if they are stuck in SAVE Yep, we all got called for fear mongering. Sure Congress via legislation could, they could also retroactively remove PSLF. Promissory estoppel would be extremely difficult to prove. But also, don't forget the 8th circuit did say any forgiveness up until the point of the injunctions was not to be touched, so that might be an extra hurdle. For me the concern is anyone who is either forgiven between the injunction and the new administration, and/or if they will honor the IDR adjustment (if by some miracle it actually gets finished) for those who are not yet forgiven (and subsequently if they will actually forgive anyone in the future). All I know is that the soon to be extinct Dept of Ed needs to get the forgiveness counts/IDR adjustment on the books, and Biden needs to forgive as many as possible under IBR. I'm sending in my IBR application today, but who knows if that will even be looked at before Jan1. This is assuming no one gets grandfathered into SAVE, honestly I can't see ANY of SAVE surviving. What a cluster @(#& This is what I'm most confused about, why exactly the forbearance doesn't count towards forgiveness. It's all tied up with IBR applications being blocked, I just don't understand how that's legal to continue to force borrowers in SAVE to stay there. I understand you can apply out and be in a 2 month processing forbearance, but after 2 months you will be back into a general forbearance which does not count towards forgiveness, so basically the same thing. Just open up the IBR applications, finish the god darn IDR adjustment, and at least get as many either forgiven, or have their counts adjusted, BEFORE the new admin takes effect. Well it's interesting that the 10th circuit ruled the opposite from the 8th circuit, I'm not really sure why the 8th's circuit ruling wins out here other than possibly because SCOTUS kicked it back to them. But at the end of the day it would all go back to SCOTUS to interpret the law. They probably stopped the IDR adjustment, although that's purely speculative. From what I understand the authority for that was via SAVE, which is mostly blocked now. That's why the dept of ed isn't forthright with borrowers about the IDR adjustment time frames, or rather the lack of time frames. He also coerced many to consolidate and lose forgiveness counts and capitalize interest. He let the dept of ed take almost 3 years to do the IDR adjustment and it's still not freaking done. I still believe he did a ton of good things, but some really dumb ones as well. Not a great article, they mention \*if\* SAVE gets approved... lol? They also mention a SCOTUS appeal, that ain't happening because the dept of ed under Trump isn't going to appeal, well I suppose unless the 8th circuit upholds SAVE, see above lol. So whatever the 8th circuit decides will likely be the law of the land. I don't disagree with staying with SAVE unless you need exactly 2 months for forgiveness. Switching to IBR you get into the 60 day forbearance which does count towards forgiveness, but after 60 days you go back into a general forbearance which does not count. Currently IBR applications aren't being processed other than that forbearance, which makes no sense at all because IBR is the only forgiveness which could be applied right now. This is a HUGE cluster exactly because the dept of ed has ZERO communication with borrowers. But would not the 8th circuit's ruling will be the law of the land because the new dept of ed will withdraw or rewrite the rules, possibly going through negotiated rule-making again, but certainly not appealing to SCOTUS? I understand there is more than the current injunctions, but with a trifecta GOP and the possibility of saying goodbye to the filibuster, well the GOP is probably going to ram through whatever legislation they want to augment the 8th circuit's decision. If you think ANY blue states or anyone else will care enough to file a lawsuit, well bridges seem to be in high demand for selling. Student debt is an unpopular issue to begin with, and I can count the number of times Harris mentioned student loans during her short campaign on zero fingers. On the other hand the GOP seems to have hit a nerve with their constituency which doesn't want to pay off ""Ivy League freeloading basket weaving majors"" student debt, that has been bought hook line and sinker. Even at best what would we see, some blue injunctions? Then a fast track to SCOTUS, then back to step 1. I just don't see the outrage, especially in regards to those borrowers who lost forgiveness counts and capitalized massive interest on the specific advice (coercion?) of the Biden admin. I do agree about the IDR adjustment, it won't surprise me in the least if it's thrown out and the recounts reversed. Just about the only possibility is that Biden forgives those on IBR, but the applications are closed so other than the 60 day processing forbearance that avenue seems completely closed off. Of course that's assuming the dept of ed actually finishes an almost 3 year old IDR adjustment, and finishes with enough time to force servicers to update. PS: Always appreciate the commentary, I wish more legal minds would comment on here. Small correction: Is it not *underwater* basket weaving that those freeloading Ivy Leaguers are spending our tax dollars on?Thanks for that I needed a laugh today. On blue states suing, I would think the harm to students would be pretty obvious, I would think the current dept of ed has a voluminous amount of financial research and how their plan massively helps student borrowers. The AG's standing would be their constituents, probably an easier hurdle than Missouri having standing because of Mohela. But again, just pipe dreams because I really doubt anyone is going to bring a suit, state or private. On the private side a class action lawsuit would be subject to promissory estoppel and the impossibility of that being used against the government. I do agree it would be great to look up any lawsuits during the first Trump term and see who the real ""friends"" of student borrowers are. At the end of the day Trump is going to rewrite the rules via legislation, and they will make sure and make it major questions doctrine friendly, aka bulletproof. It's just amazing to me how much in this country is going to massively change in the next 4 years. The one thing I'm most curious about is promissory estoppel. That the government can get away with what IMO is basically coercion to consolidate, capitalize accrued interest, and lose forgiveness counts, is just incredible. I'm far from an attorney, but the best read I've had was [this ]( discusses how difficult it would be to claim promissory estoppel if say the gov **retroactively** legislated PSLF away.Again let me reiterate just how surreal it is for the millions who consolidated on the dept of ed and Biden admin's ""promises,"" and I quote that because those ""promises"" sure as hell were not written in the promissory contract. I just cannot fathom that there is no recourse to this as far as I can tell, at least no one is talking about it.*In the event of a congressional repeal of the PSLF program, many of the plaintiff-borrowers' Tucker Act claims would be unlikely to survive as a basis to collect money damages. Any equitable estoppel claims would also likely fail. The borrowers, however, would have an alternative, political recourse. With the help of consumer advocacy groups, they should be able to lobby before Congress and the President to try and ensure that if an amendment or repeal does occur, it is done so in a way that--at the very least--protects the most vulnerable and at-risk members in various communities. Such an approach may have broader implications beyond PSLF.*"
Alternative-Rub-7445,1.060056788392232,1.0,0.06005678839223205,Neutral,"I finished graduate school in 2013. I've been paying monthly since the end of 2013. As of 12/24, I officially have qualified for PSLF (Public Service Loan Forgiveness), and got my remaining student loan balance forgiven. I couldn't be happier. I thought this was all a legend and didn't know anyone who qualified yet, but I've met my agreement terms and gotten $185k+ gone from my life. I work in local government now, but to qualify you have to work in non-profit work I've been part of this program for an over a decade. I consolidated my loans in 2014 & applied for PSLF. I took out $274,266, paid around $500/month, still owed $185k including interest. I enjoyed my experience but now that I'm grown and wiser, I would've gone to schools that were cheaper though they really elevated my employment prospects They told me I have a couple of months overpayment as well Not zero interest. I think last I checked it was $130k principle & $40k + interest I owe Well, no, I would've paid more if I was required to, but I wasn't per the program. My job is fine. Thanks for the wellWishes Entitlement how? I never said I was entitled to anything. I just fulfilled a contractual agreement & the government kept good on their part of the contract they entered into with me Seems it all worked out just fine so no mistake here I have a Bachelors in Chemistry & a Masters in Public Health. I work in Public Health Admin Nope. I just fulfilled the terms of my contract. Provided my services, got something in return--over 10 yrs working toward it. I guess you can feel how you want about it but either way, I'm forgiven lol Hmm, kinda but finished on time. I started in undergrad as Psych, switched to bio, ended in chemistry--finished in 4 years with honors and busted my ass to do so. And my Masters was just 2 years My schools were private. I can't say they were my best decisions but they were decisions I made in my youth so I found programs to help me remedy. I was a student on a Pell grant--no money, my student loans had to pay for my books, room/board, health insurance and living expenses. I took out what I needed to live with the understanding that I had to pay it back. Yes! PSLF you have to be on an income based plan & have your loans consolidated to join the program & you certify your employment yearly. I really appreciate that. I just loss my grandma who raised me 2 weeks ago so I was reeling so getting this email was a great bright spot. Cheers to 2025 I did earn it. I appreciate the kind words. I recertified for the last time & went into administrative forbearance with MOHELA on 9/25, and got the official email 12/24 Definitely. No need to make more payments than necessary I qualified through the Public Service Loam Forgiveness Program Thanks! I'm so glad! It was a great email to receive for sure! The program didn't exist when I took my loans out and I was prepared to have to pay them back, but the program was offered and I took advantage of it. They needed me for something, I needed them for something. I certainly did not. I only learned about it after struggling to make my payments and I went to a financial planner in my city & she told me about PSLF. They don't even tell borrowers about it. I learned about it in desperation. They needed me to work a public service job making penny's with the promise of forgiveness instead of going corporate and making actual money. School tuition increases bc they can raise it, whether the few of us were getting ours forgiven after meeting our end of an agreement, or not. That's not my fault. I would've much rather not had to take out loans for college but alas I have a bachelors in Chem & a Master's in Public Health Mainly my Masters bc I had to take out loans for housing, though I did still work. I have a bachelors in Chemistry and a Masters in Public Health That's awful. I'm so sorry. They did make this process needlessly complicated I've been in the PSLF program for over 10yrs. I applied a long time ago & worked toward the payments Nope. PSLF is bipartisan What are you talking about? ""Can't pay?"" I signed a contract 10 years ago that if I made my payments & worked for 10 years then the remainder would be forgiven. That's all that happened. I fulfilled my obligation as set forth by the federal government who created this program to encourage college educated people to work in public service jobs. I also work my ass off, and I paid my car off myself :) Wasn't weird to mention. They edited their comment. It originally said their neighbor works at 6am everyday and busts their ass to pay their bills & their car off & didn't get their car loan forgiven.I said I also worked hard & I paid my car off myself The federal government wrote it off. They made an agreement with me & I fulfilled my end of it with 10 years of service & on time payments. I'm a girl but yes lol I got no pay outs & this isn't a mortgage. I am still required to pay that. You're not paying for it in the least. ??? The first folks to be able to qualify for forgiveness weren't until 2019 I think This is not under Biden. PSLF started under the Obama admin I went into forbearance with my servicer in October, & submitted my employment certification. Just got notified last week Idk. Mine were forgiven through PSLF. I've been going through this process for 10 years I don't control it? Thank you. I'm so confused here by many of the comments. People upset with me for qualifying for a program that the government started over a decade ago, lmfao. I paid what they told me to per their calculation. Doesn't matter now though. Congrats on paying your loans off! Thanks! No, I'm a person who got their federal student loan debt forgiven. I could see how my wording could be confusing Lmfao. Get over it. I didn't steal anything. I did agree to pay it, and then I agreed to work somewhere for 10 years while making payments & have the rest forgiven--my lender agreed. No lies here. I will soak it up. Thanks. You're welcome If you're in student loan debt with the federal government, you can work for a non-profit and pay for 10 years on an income based plan and they may forgive it. Else, you'll need to be a bank. Hope this helps What did you do for me? Surely not taxes because I also pay those. Again, you've done nothing for me. Anything you done for me isn't more than my tax contribution. Your taxes go to wars. You're welcome I can use my degree & training in the private sector & I likely will. I worked in the public sector because it was offered to me that if I used my skills there and helped, they would help me out--so I did. I paid. I just fulfilled my contract. I do feel special bc so many more people deserve this access but don't have it. I give back daily--it's kinda the premise of the forgiveness program Yes I was responsible for it. The government entered into a contract with me that if I worked where they needed me to & paid my loans for 10 years they would forgive what was left. I did so they did. Glad it all worked out for me. lol, what are you even talking about? Everything I did was legal Cry about it, I guess. This program has been around through 4 US presidents--started under Bush Jr. You are ill informed. PSLF was started to encourage skilled workers to work in public service jobs in exchange for loan forgiveness. You're welcome The program I completed existed long before Biden was elected No, he didn't. I'm not a Biden hater (nor lover), but Biden didn't do anything special for me is all I'm saying. I paid for 10 years, worked where they said I needed to and was forgiven per the contract I think it's pretty great & I'm grateful for it."
Expensive-Annual1024,0.9999976602131344,1.1863388195158127,-0.18634115930267825,Neutral,"During his first term, he proposed an income-driven repayment program for borrowers that would cap payments at 12.5 percent of income and discharge remaining balances after 15 years of repayments. He also signed an executive order forgiving the student debt owed by severely disabled veterans.And when he couldn't persuade Congress in August 2020 to extend the pandemic pause on student loan payments, Trump invoked executive action to extend the moratorium, setting the stage for the Biden administration to repeatedly extend the policy for another 2 1/2 years.From the article. The funny thing is, this entire board is all doom and gloom with Trump but these things mentioned aren't bad. Dude was trying to get the Covid Forbearance extended, Congress was the one that said no, so he had to do an executive action. And the 12.5% for 15 years is a pretty middle ground for all repayment plans. Just like the Rep sued Biden, the Dem states sued Trump. California is a very likely state that could go to bat over this: [ ""It's going to be insanely complicated,"" said Michael Brickman, who was a senior Education Department official during the first Trump administration. ""You really can't overstate the mess that this new administration is inheriting.""It could be VERY simple. Allow the one time account adjustment as that seems fair. All people NOT enrolled into SAVE reverts their pending apps to REPAYE. Allow people on SAVE to stay there for UP TO 1 year (cause some people haven't sent in income info in YEARS) and then start the recert process up. Those in SAVE will be moved back into REPAYE once they recert. Boom, fixed. As for the almost 40k apps for school discharge, make a case of how the school mislead you and everything. If you got a degree and it's helped, you shouldn't get discharged. Shoot, the army and all that is at all high schools with a much stronger marketing and getting you to sign (I know I almost did). That's some BS tactics there. REPAYE wasn't shitty. It will be interesting to see if it is brought back or not. That is the 50-50 question right now. As someone who said SAVE would be taken down back July 2023 and no one batted an eye, I don't see IBR going away. What I'm 50-50 on is if REPAYE comes back or not. That's the iffy part and where my head is. The poll, from the Associated Press and the University of Chicago, found that, overall, 39% of adults think it's extremely or very important for the U.S. government to provide student loan relief. More adults -- 51% -- say the government should relieve medical debt.Democrats (58%) were far more likely than Independents (44%) or Republicans (15%) to back student loan relief, which means, post-election and with Republicans ascendant in Washington, borrowers will need to get used to a new normal and new priorities. Which is something I always hammered on here. It is a SMALL size of people with student loan debt that needs help. It's not a HUGE issue in America compared to medical debt and the many other issues with our country. This hope for a ""dark Brandon"" is laughable. Out of the MANY issues out there, student loans isn't high on the list. I would think the trans issue is more higher at this point. And sorry to say, the common American isn't taking out lots of student loans. If they were, this would be a much higher topic for both parties to talk about. Neither mentioned much to do with student loans as they focused on many other issues. We are NOT a priority. While Betsy was TERRIBLE, the rules were very...let's say unclear to a lot of student loan borrowers. For PSLF, you needed direct loans (let's be honest, many people still had FFEL loans), did not make payments on time, consolidation started the clock all over, PSLF application had to be filled out 100% correct (even the date had to be exactly how it was laid out or it would be denied and yes, Fedloan denied MANY due to date being incorrect), correct repayment plan, lenders keep switching and losing loan history, etc. And this happened under Obama as well (yes, people didn't reach the 10 years under him, but people still could turn in applications that got denied left and right). Biden basically said all these rules are poo-poo and counted sooooo many things that should have never be counted under the IDR Adjustment (which is an amazing thing for people that honestly did not know) to try to fix the system. Again, not excusing Betsy at all as she should not have been in charge of education (she probably couldn't even manage a Walmart or McDonald's), but the system was broken way before her. Unless someone reminds him, he probably forgot all about SAVE lol. Of course he was going to protect his son before Trump could go after him."
Ok-Nefariousness-927,0.9795377294561576,1.2750490712520497,-0.2955113417958921,Neutral,"To actually answer your question, student loans are more difficult to pay off for a list of interrelated reasons. First, the loans are structured differently, simple versus compound interest. Simple interest is based on the original principal, while compound interest includes accumulated interest. This first point sets the stage against the borrower of a student loan. I didn't think people really understand this one difference is the root cause for why student loans are so hard to pay off. When taken in context with the following 3 related points, you'll understand how compound interest loans are the start of the problem and every issue a borrower encounters is made worse from this type of loan structure. See example below. Second, loan terms for student loans are standard at 10 years versus 5-6 for auto making point one even harder to pay off. The longer term increases the total borrowing costs and multiplies the impact of student loan interest. Third, auto loans require principal and interest to be paid reducing the amount you owe over time. Student loans can be income based and allow you to make a payment less than what is accrued in interest each month. Again, coupled with point 1 and 2 compounding the problem of student loan payments being hard to pay off. Fourth, careers aren't straight lines and people are often dealing with the messy middle. People have gaps in employment, the economy, or you name it. New grads are entering a stage of life where they're balancing saving for retirement, starting to have kids, helping their parents, etc. All while making the lowest amount of their careers. As people experience wrinkles in their income, all three previous points compound the interest a person owes. The result is that all 4 of these issues work against borrowers in a student loan making it much harder to pay off a student loan than a car loan. Simple vs compound interest exampleFor a $30,000 loan, here's the breakdown of simple vs. compound interest:Simple Interest * Calculation: Interest is calculated solely on the original principal amount. * Example: If the annual interest rate is 5%, the yearly interest would always be $1,500 (5% of $30,000). * Total Cost: Lower overall cost compared to compound interest.Compound Interest * Calculation: Interest is calculated on both the principal and accumulated interest. * Example: If the annual interest rate is 5% compounded monthly, the interest in the first month would be calculated on the $30,000. In the second month, it would be calculated on the $30,000 plus the interest earned in the first month, and so on. * Total Cost: Higher overall cost due to the ""interest on interest"" effect.Let's illustrate with an example: * Loan Amount: $30,000 * Annual Interest Rate: 5% * Loan Term: 5 years * Simple Interest: * Total Interest Paid: $7,500 * Total Repayment: $37,500 * Compound Interest (monthly compounding): * Total Interest Paid: $8,500.76 * Total Repayment: $38,500.76Key Differences: * Calculation Method: Simple interest is based on the original principal, while compound interest includes accumulated interest. * Cost: Compound interest generally leads to higher total costs over time. * Common Usage: * Simple interest: Often used for short-term loans. * Compound interest: Common in credit cards, mortgages, and long-term investments.In Summary:While simple interest loans are generally cheaper upfront, compound interest loans can significantly increase the total cost, especially over longer periods. It's crucial to understand the implications of each type of interest before taking on any loan."
hotjambalaya17,0.9870565418894705,1.3603109229264148,-0.3732543810369443,Neutral,"[ the College Cost Reduction Act, federal student loan repayment options would be narrowed down to just two: a Standard plan, and a new IDR plan called the ""Repayment Assistance Plan."" This new plan would be based on income just like existing IDR plans, and would use a formula similar to the PAYE and REPAYE plans. However, it would eliminate student loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years in repayment. Instead, borrowers would only qualify for loan forgiveness once they have repaid ""the total amount of principal and interest that the borrower would have repaid under a standard repayment plan."" Some lower-income borrowers or those with high balances may never pay that amount, which could lead to some people being trapped in debt for their entire lives. **Under the current version of the bill, the changes would apply to ""All loans made... on or after July 1, 2024."" This suggests that borrowers already in repayment would be able to maintain access to existing IDR plans**."" Tech college is the key. Or trades apprenticeships. The four year model of college was something our parents and grandparents aspired to. It meant that they might be able to work in an air conditioned office, sit down all day, and get a couple of weeks of paid vacation/holidays every year. I don't believe the cost of education is worth it for those types of jobs any longer. My son in law is an electrician apprentice and he makes close to $50K/year at age 21; he'll make $75-80K in the next three years and then be able to own his own business. He spent $0 on his education. A tech school will cost about $1800/semester and books are usually included. Nurses, sonographers, etc make $80K to start--Yes it's a tough job with long shifts, holiday work, etc, but it is a valuable career, low debt and high employability. It's hard for me to even think of a terminal 4 year degree (one that does not require more debt for a masters or doctorate) that gets anywhere close to these starting salaries. Let's abandon the idea that four year colleges make kids more well rounded and instead focus on training the next generation of healthcare and trades professionals. That will solve the student loan problem and the underemployment problem for many grads. No. PSLF is written in a law passed by congress. For that to end, congress would have to pass a law. I guess that could happen, but unlikely given the constituents in each state/district would not be happy with their rep. I'm gonna try to be optimistic. Yes, the repayment plans will be more restrictive than those that were implemented under Biden. However, it is not as black and white as Biden-Good, Trump-Bad. If you read further down in the article, you'll see other elements that will mirror some of what Biden implemented. As a recipient of loan forgiveness under Biden I am grateful for it. However, the implementation was horrible. If you're a loan holder, you know the long wait times for a call to go thru, representatives that don't know the system (after holding the balance for over 30 years, I know the process better than any of them did), random irrelevant letters or emails etc. The uncertainty was probably the worst part--hearing about a relief plan, then having it reversed because it was not legal, or getting no updates for a year or more knowing that you qualified for relief but it was never processed. A new program seemed to be rolled out every other month and no one was equipped to implement it, leading to borrower frustration. Maybe this will simplify things and bring more people to debt relief. Below is another quote from the article that highlights some of these elements, which student loan advocate groups support.# Other Elements Of Proposal Would Impact Origination And Other Student Loan Forgiveness ProgramsThe elimination of time-based IDR student loan forgiveness is not the only item in the GOP-sponsored College Cost Reduction Act. Other provisions, which some borrower advocates would support, include:* The elimination of the Parent PLUS and Graduate PLUS loan programs. Some advocates support this move, as these loans tend to have higher interest rates and can leave parents and older borrowers stuck in significant debt. However, other advocates are concerned that eliminating these programs would force borrowers to rely on riskier private student loans that don't qualify for IDR or loan forgiveness and typically have inflexible repayment terms.* A second chance for borrowers in default on their student loans to get back into good standing through the federal student loan rehabilitation program.* An interest subsidy for the new IDR plan ""for each month for which a borrower' s aggregate monthly payment... is insufficient to pay the total amount of interest that accrues on a loan for the month,"" as well as the ability for payments to go directly towards principal in certain circumstances.* The elimination of most instances of interest capitalization.* A repeal of the Biden administration's ""gainful employment,"" Borrower Defense to Repayment, and Closed School Discharge regulations, and a limitation on the ability of future presidential administration to draft new regulations expanding student loan forgiveness initiatives. At a macro level, loaned money is never free. Inflation continues every year leading to a diminished value of the dollar. What you could buy for $4.00 10 years ago is now probably $8 or $9 (think fast food). So, if the lender, government or bank, does not charge interest, then they are losing money by lending it. Someone is going to take a bath when money is lent and the recipient signs up to take on the interest. If the government lends out money with no interest, then the value of that money plummets over time. And, if that happens, college costs will go up as those schools have the most to gain while the economy tanks. Borrowed money is never free."
xantharia,1.0,1.3821172480170152,-0.3821172480170152,Neutral,"American institutions become extremely inefficient the moment government gets involved. eg building subways in the US is four times more expensive than in Paris; prescription drugs are way more expensive than elsewhere but non-prescription drugs are cheaper; military weapons are way more expensive than other countries yet civilian industrials are on-par, etc. And likewise American colleges were way more affordable (relative to median income) before the Department of Education started offering grants and loans. Government involvement simply removes the incentive for prospective students to factor price into their college choices, and they rewarded the colleges that have the highest inflation. Any college that tries to keep costs in check simply ends up with less government handouts and loans. eg Harvard's endowment is so big that they could easily eliminate all tuition. But instead they post a super-high ticket price while being generous with financial aid. This way they capture the deep pockets of government and private grants and loans while stressing the budgets of upper-middle-class parents, but reserving a free ride for low income students. But the posted ticket price is matched by all peer institutions making the entire market unaffordable for both upper-middle-class Americans and the taxpayers.The truth is that if college is too expensive for individual families to pay, then it's too expensive for the taxpayers to pay as well. If we want higher education to become more efficient and deliver a less expensive product we need to ban all government grants and loans. Let market forces reward colleges that supply better value. I wish I knew. Some hypotheses: Maybe US business is so expert at maximizing profit that any interaction with government bureaucrats results in profiteers running rings around them. Or maybe it relates to American tort laws and litigiousness -- e.g. how the California high speed rail inflated from \~$35 billion to now well over $100 billion, and it might never be completed. A significant fraction of that budget goes to lawyers -- e.g. the way that the rail path was decided before all the land was purchased, so the remaining land owners naturally knew that they could demand the sky given that the project has no choice but to buy their land.As an expat in Asia, I'm constantly astonished at how good public services are. e.g. the super-low-tax city of Hong Kong has a fantastic subway system that actually makes money. Or take Singapore that constantly grows its subway with low fares, yet this is a low-tax country (e.g. if you earn $100k you pay less than 5% in income tax) -- yet they buy the very best military jets, etc. Compare with New York City that has an expensive and money-losing antique subway system in a high tax state with its own high city taxes, high property tax, high sales tax, etc, and where train fares are super expensive. The bridges have been collecting huge fares for decades after decades. Where does all this money go??Simple example: During COVID, Singapore developed a smartphone app for contact tracing, to control access to public buildings, and to show proof of vaccination and PCR testing. It worked really well and the total budget was $7.5 million. Meanwhile New York City produced a similar app, but that was super buggy, offered fewer features, and ultimately was abandoned as a failure. The total budget for that failed product was $250 million, with a good chuck going to IBM. Why were Singapore's bureaucrats so much more efficient in contracting out their project?? I don't know.It's perhaps worth noting that the US wasn't always this way. The Hoover Dam was the wonder of the world back in the day, yet it was built ahead of schedule and under budget -- impossible to imagine today. Of course, by comparison to today's environmental rules, standards, and safety systems and regulations, those for Hoover Dam were almost nonexistent. Indeed, the fraction of budgets that go to administrative and regulatory compliance is massive today, and largely serviced by consultant companies and law firms that are famous for charging an arm and a leg by the hour. Consider that when San Fran wanted to create a new rapid transit bus route -- presumably to save on congestion and pollution -- the environmental review for the project took [13 years to complete]( and probably cost many millions of dollars. That's 13 years of extra congestion and pollution just to do the paperwork for the environmental impact assessment! Why didn't someone high up in city government simply say ""yeah, let's skip the 13 year environmental review and just call this transit project a net environmental benefit"" -- well probably because the environmental consultancy companies spend millions lobbying state government for more stringent and more complex regulations. Huh? Are you kidding? The private over-priced schools are the ones that fleece the government the most! They get the gravy both ways. I work in this business and I've seen how it works. e.g. The total cost of attendance for Harvard Medical School is about $110,000 x 4.5, or $495,000. So you're probably thinking ""yeah, but all those professor salaries are really high"" -- except that Harvard Medical School gives new junior faculty 3-4 years to get enough research funding to fully cover their own salaries, otherwise they won't get tenure and they'd be fired. This means that some 80% of the faculty have their salaries paid for not by the school but by the taxpayer, which amounts to between $200,000 and $400,000 per professor per year. And yet, despite having the taxpayer pay for most of Harvard Medical School's faculty salaries, they still charge half a million dollars to their students! Why do they do that? Because they can! Because loans are available to medical students to cover this. (Which means that when new doctors graduate, they're pressured to pursue expensive specializations so that they can repay these huge debts). Meanwhile, on every NIH grant awarded to a Harvard Medical School professor, the university takes an additional 70% in ""overhead"" -- supposedly to cover the costs of electricity, facilities, administrative management, etc. Meaning that if you got a $1,000,000 research grant from NIH, the university separately gets an additional $700,000 from the taxpayer. But if the grant money came from a private foundation, the university only takes some 20% to 30% in overhead. Why so much less? Doesn't electricity (etc) cost just as much? Well, it's simply because private foundations won't put up with exorbitant rates, while these universities have lobbyists in Washington to convince Congress to pay them exorbitant overhead rates.Suppose we look at Harvard Graduate Schools tuition rates for Ph.D. students:* Year 1: $55,656* Year 2: $55,656* Year 3: $14,470* Year 4: $14,470* Year 5+: $3,682In the sciences, you typically take 2-4 courses in the first two years, and after that you're only doing lab research (which isn't costing the university anything because research is sponsored by NSF or NIH). So are these 2-4 courses really worth $100k? And why is tuition $3,682 per year after your fourth year? Well, here's how it works: some students enter graduate school having been awarded a fellowship (e.g. NIH, NSF, DOD, Howard Hughes, etc) while other students don't have fellowships. For the second group, the university automatically waives their tuition for years 1-4. But they publish the official $140,252 rate for years 1-4 precisely so that they can charge this to the taxpayer via the fellowships. Why does it drop off so much after year 4? Because fellowships only pay for four years. The bottom line is that these are all funny numbers invented to charge as much as possible to the taxpayer, but once students are no longer covered then a more realistic rate of $3,682 kicks in (seeing as graduate students hardly cost anything because they're doing their own research and not taking classes). The bottom line is that the least efficient and most expensive schools get the most amount of federal money, either through loans and grants to students, or by making the taxpayer pay the professor's salaries, or by overcharging overhead rates, or by trying to charge federal fellowships as much as possible. Well, I think it's complicated. America clearly has some structural problems in law and governance that need to be fixed, and it's not just in government services. Plenty of private-sector services have managed to avoid anti-trust protections and end up being extremely inefficient. For example, I have purchased package bundles for ""home fibre internet + cable TV + fixed line + cell phone"" in Asia, Europe, and the US. In Asia I pay about $35 a month, in Europe I pay $45 a month. But in the US with Xfinity I pay around $230 per month. Why is there inadequate competition to bring down the price in the US? Probably because companies like AT&T, Comcast, etc., have managed to lobby politicians and regulators to avoid healthy competition. But I don't favor too much government inside or outside of the US. In general, government is less efficient than private companies -- that's just the nature of the beast. A private business prospers by maximizing revenue and minimizing costs, so it thrives on efficiency. Government services thrive on bloat. e.g. Biden's $7.5 billion investment in EV charging has only produced 7 stations in two years, while Tesla installs 350 stations every year for far less money.Our overall prosperity depends on the overall productivity of the economy in aggregate. If trucks can deliver food cheaper, then the food sold in stores is cheaper, and as a result you can purchase more food in return for each hour of your work -- which means that you are now more prosperous. If we imagine that the national economy is like a giant clock with zillions of cogs (each representing private and public services), the efficiency of the economy as a whole is measured by how much input energy it takes to ultimately move the hands of the clock. Less efficient cogs take more energy to spin, perhaps because they don't have enough oil. But they reduce overall productivity because everything is interconnected. If government services are responsible for a larger fraction of GDP, it means that overall the economy is less efficient and therefore overall there is less prosperity for everyone. We are seeing that in France right now, with government's fraction of the economy being above 55% of GDP, and as a result per-capita GDP for French people is falling. With each year the French actually get poorer. The US government's fraction was about 10% of GDP under FDR, and today it's around (I think) about 35%. So it's increasing, which is bad, but still small enough that the economy in aggregate is more efficient than the French economy. Of course government plays essential roles in any economic system -- e.g. to track and protect private property, to provide defense, to prevent monopolies, to regulate against negative externalities, and to avoid a ""tragedy of the commons"" by being responsible for common spaces. But we should always avoid allowing government to provide services where private businesses (in healthy competition) are more efficient. You call it the ""property-owning class"" but in a healthy market-driven economy, this includes almost everyone to some degree or another. It's easy to see why this is so important by looking at countries that lack solid property title systems: they stay mired in poverty. Much of Latin America and Africa have people living on land informally -- i.e. ask small farmers in Columbia or Guatemala, and many don't have titles to the lands that they use. A rich plantation company or mining concern with lots of lawyers and political influence can suddenly buy the land from the state, making the little farmers destitute. Without titles they cannot use their property as equity for a loan to buy a tractor, for example. Yet modern economies achieve incredible levels of productivity by making expensive investments that are only possible through a chain of loans based on various kinds of proven equity. Mexico has lots of informal houses that are built brick-by-brick over 10+ years because their ""owners"" have no basis to get a loan to build the house in one go. To build a house efficiently a building company needs a crane, but those easily cost $500,000 -- how can a small company buy this? Again, through a chain of titles, where, say, their existing fleet of pickup trucks and power tools can be used as equity for a new loan. Bottom line is that the efficient allocation of capital depends on tracking and defending property rights. Government's role in providing the legal infrastructure for defending property rights is essential. As I've mentioned separately, if competition cannot be assured, there are instances where we have no choice but to make the government responsible for such services. I find US health care so appallingly inefficient that I'd probably favor a single-payer solution as a last resort, i.e. Medicare for all where the government is the single-payer and thereby gets to dictate prices. The Japanese have a successful healthcare system of private insurance and private suppliers but with government-imposed caps on the cost of services (e.g. there's a massive database listing every medical procedure and this database dictates the maximum allowable charge for each service). Do Medicare bureaucrats have the capacity to do the same without being undermined by Congressmen influenced by lobbyists?Pharma prices are again where US government regulations seem to cause massive inefficiencies. The instant that a drug is designated ""prescription only"" means that various middlemen capitalize on government regulation to triple the price. Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company works to bypass this weirdly inefficient pharmaceutical supply chain and thereby manages to sell drugs without insurance discounts for \*less\* than what many Americans pay \*with\* their insurance discounts! Consider that the popular drug Ozempic costs about $150/month outside of the US (without any insurance or subsidies) but costs closer to $1,500/month in the US. Somehow the instant that the FDA designates a drug as ""prescription only,"" the effect of the special handling regulations on the supply chain is that the price jacks up by an order of magnitude. Americans should be able to buy Ozempic online from, say, Singapore, which would instantly drop the price by 90% -- but the FDA doesn't allow this. Bernie Sanders keeps blaming Novo Nordisk for the high price in the US without admitting that much of this premium is peculiar to the system of distribution under FDA's rules, and not the fault of Novo Nordisk. An essential component of all this is competition. A natural selection among businesses allows only the more efficient ones to survive because they get more clients by offering better value. With Soviet factories, the inefficient ones were awarded by Moscow bureaucrats with more investment and more manpower to help them improve their productivity. This creates an incentive for factories to be less efficient so that they can attract more investment. In the west, the inefficient factories lose investment because shareholders sell their stocks, and such companies ultimately go bankrupt. The result is that by the time of reunification, West Germany was incredibly richer, more productive, and less polluting than East Germany. So yes, we cannot allow an economy where there is only one trucking company. Some domains form natural monopolies, e.g. water utilities, in which case a government-run service may be better than a private monopoly. One common solution is for governments to issue time-limited concessions through open competition. Private companies offer bids to purchase concessions and the winner has a contractual agreement to supply x amount of water for y costs over z time period. These can work well, but they are tricky and require very smart government bureaucrats. You want the concessions to expire frequently enough to allow a more efficient company to win the next bid. But you don't want it to be too frequent or the companies won't be willing to invest in infrastructure for the long term. We've seen instances where the government auctioning of cellular bands as been very successful, and other instances where the government is hoodwinked by cellular companies conspiring illegally to divvy up the market so as to minimize competition (e.g. through secret codes hidden in their auction bids). Another natural monopoly is the rail system, seeing as few countries have spare land to build new railroads so the existing rail beds form natural monopolies. Countries shift back and forth between private and government run systems as neither is very satisfying in the long term. Currently EU rules are pressuring state rail companies to be privatized, whereas the UK is unhappy with its complex system of private rail companies and state-owned track, so the UK is now talking about re-nationalizing. The US has been very successful with a suite of private freight companies, but unsuccessful with Amtrak (technically private but effectively a government-run monopoly). The only successful high speed rail has been private, e.g. Brightline in Florida. State projects suffer because the longer that contractors delay completion, the more money they get from the state. Brightline is finishing projects at blazing speed in part because the longer it takes for them to complete a project, the more money they lose. An essential component of all this is competition. A natural selection among businesses allows only the more efficient ones to survive because they get more clients by offering better value.

Brightline is finishing projects at blazing speed in part because the longer it takes for them to complete a project, the more money they lose. The rare and weird world of US healthcare is the remarkable situation where economists predict that in theory it cannot work and in fact it doesn't work! Having an effective price cap by virtue of a single payer is something of a last resort to fix a broken system -- and even that may not work. e.g. if powerful labour unions win supplementary insurance for their members this would undermine the power of the single payer. I favor this only because the existing model is so shockingly bad. It's still very risky to have bureaucrats decide on prices because it's so hard for \*anyone\* to know what are the ""true"" prices of goods, services, and wages. Only a true free market provides these numbers automatically. There are lots of other possible models. For example, Germany, Switzerland, etc. have private insurance and private providers, but the interaction between the two is tightly regulated. In the US, the hospitals spend huge efforts overcharging the insurance (e.g. charging $50 per Tylenol pill!) while insurance companies spend equal efforts trying to minimize payouts. As a result, close to a third of healthcare costs are spent on medical administration alone. The tight regulation in Germany minimizes any wiggle-room between insurance and providers, which minimizes administrative overhead, and in the end the insurance companies mainly compete for patients based on how quickly and easily they reimburse them. A third model is what we see in Portugal where the insurance services and the hospital services belong to the same company. The companies compete for clients based on reputation and value, but otherwise costs are fairly well optimized. Another option that might work in the US is if (1) healthcare providers are not allowed to have different pricing for different insurance networks (2) healthcare providers must post all their rates (e.g. using machine-readable formats like RDF and detailed ontologies) (3) insurance companies are not allowed to cover 100% of costs, i.e. clients must pay some fraction of the bill up to a certain cutoff (e.g. 10%-30%, capped at $1000-$5000/year). (4) The highly granular published prices should allow AI to minimize administration and give insurance companies the ability to vary percent coverage depending on the provider. Various third-party AI-driven services inform patients what is the best value for money in their area for all combinations of insurance provider and healthcare provider. This would create an incentive for both healthcare providers and insurance companies to offer more efficient services because patients will make decisions based on value for money. e.g. Person A might be willing to pay $200 for a consultation with hardly any waiting time, while person B might prefer to pay $20 for a consultation with a longer waiting time. Typically the savings are passed on to the consumer. e.g. the profit margins for supermarkets are razor-thin because they compete neck-and-neck. If one supermarket manages to improve their efficiency they will try to attract more customers by offering lower prices. Some businesses offer unique products and charge a premium despite relegating themselves to a smaller market share -- e.g. Apple enjoys huge profit margins. But people can still buy Android phones at much lower cost from companies that compete on price and have thinner profit margins. Government-backed loans means that the treasury prints money with the promise that this debt is paid back with future labour. When you ""forgive"" loans, basically it means that you've printed money backed by zero labour. ie it's like printing counterfeit money. This is ""paid"" for through currency deflation, which is the same as inflation of goods and services. And inflation is the worst kind of tax because it hits lower income people disproportionately harder than upper income people. So you're making the non-college educated pay for the tuitions of the college educated. It's Robin Hood in reverse. It's ironic that the Dems lost the election because of the inflation caused by dumping $5 trillion of debt-financed COVID dollars onto the economy. And yet here Biden is still adding more to inflation by cancelling student debt."
robotlasagna,0.95,1.3873774886637424,-0.4373774886637425,Neutral,"PPP is a loan that can be forgiven under specific guidelines If the business does not conform to those guidelines they have to pay back the loan.Student loans were never designed to be forgiven under ~~any~~ most circumstances.Edit: There are some rare exceptions for student loan discharge but by design the program was made to minimize the lender risk of loss because otherwise they would never lend to students (the absolute highest risk borrowers) or they would only lend at exorbitantly high interest rates (39%). If they are adjustable rate loans then yes they are! (Federal student loans are fixed rate.)If what you are asking is if specific types of student loans are designed to be predatory then again the answer is yes!Now I absolutely understand that it sucks to be saddled with student debt/education that you may have overpaid for but that's not an acceptable reason to forgive these loans. The reason for that is that it creates risk for anyone that issues debt if they believe a future administration might cancel that debt. The result is that companies, homeowners, small business owners stop getting loans which then causes the economy to falter.However there is no fundamental reason why congress cannot make a student whole by simply issuing a another loan with forgiveness provisions to the student which the student then uses to pay off the original loan. As long as the student follows the provisions of the program that gets forgiven and the student is out of debt. The government could attach some basic provisions that are good for society in general like: apply for the loan program, get the loan, pay off the original loan, do X hours of community service per $1000 borrowed cleaning up parks or streets or whatever and upon completion the program the loan is forgiven. The community wins, the student wins, they get out of debt and they pay a small price of helping the community. Yes its tough because the whole reason for making student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy was not some malicious thing but rather to make higher education as widely available as possible to everyone. The problem is that the borrowers, teenagers are \*literally\* the highest risk group for default. No rational lender would lend large amounts to teenagers unless the interest rates were very high to offset the default risk. But with the non-dischargeable provision the risk of default is far lower and the risk of non payment is virtually eliminated. The fact is that almost all student loans get paid off eventually which means borrowers could offer very low rates to students.Now that I'm a full grown adult I realize that is naive and stupid but that's what we fully believed at 18, and I think that's a part of this too.This is the predatory part. What economists understood but politicians didn't (or didn't want to hear) was that all this cheap money chasing education would result in massive tuition inflation and also things like ""video game design school"" or any of the other terrible for-profit bogus college programs. The government did own up to its lack of oversight of the kinds of schools it allowed to use the program and they have corrected that by removing them from the student loan program but we are still left with the current situation where tuitions are prohibitively high even at proper schools. The market will eventually correct itself but there will definitely be more pain in the interim. I always tell people in these conversations; It stops getting more expensive when people stop paying more."
