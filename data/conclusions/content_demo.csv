"PPP loans were passed by legislation and designed to be forgiven if used properly, but [Trump removed the oversight]( which was shady at best.It's important to remember the field of law is a creation. It was made by people and has no inherit truth. What is legal and what is not is subjective in many cases. Student loan forgiveness is one such case. Roe v Wade is another. See the Dobbs decision and compare that to the prior Roe v. Wade ruling. They're inconsistent and incompatible because the justices hearing the case had different ideologies and personal beliefs.",Rule 7: reddiquette / site rules / illegal / off-topic
"Forgiveness? Yes. I do still have some hope for the SAVE plan, just because overturning it would be such a wild stretch of the law.","As is being well-covered already by other subs, Donald Trump is the apparent president-elect:* [/r/politics - Megathread: Donald Trump is elected 47th president of the United States]( [/r/worldnews - World Reacts as Trump Presidential Victory Appears Imminent]( [/r/news - Donald Trump wins 2nd term in historic return to White House]( is the /r/studentloans megathread for the topic -- other threads will be locked or deleted.At the moment, there is significant speculation, but no concrete information, about what the incoming Administration will change from President Biden's student loan policies. It's likely that the changes brought about by the SAVE plan regulations and other regulations that have made forgiveness easier over the past four years will be rolled back in some way. But we don't know in what way, or what those changes would mean for any given borrower. We also don't know what, if any, actions the incumbent Administration will take in the next few weeks, before they leave office.Changes may also depend on whether Republicans control the House or not (they are already projected to win Senate control). As of the time of this post, that is also unknown.All of the above are fair game to discuss in this thread (consistent with the regular rules of the sub -- esp. Rule 7) as is speculation about what new/different student loan policies the new Trump Administration or Congress may implement, beyond merely undoing Biden Administration rules."
This bill is terrible and if they do manage to pass it via reconciliation Democrats would surely undo it via reconciliation as soon as they retake the majority.,"""Getting rid of ED"" is a misleading promise, at best. Even if the Department stopped issuing new direct loans and Pell Grants, the government would still own and need to service the existing debts for many years. (And ED does much, much more than just student aid -- those other functions would also need to be wound down over many years or transferred to other departments, meaning that ED would sort of ""move"" not disappear.) This would also require an act of Congress; presidents can't eliminate agencies on their own.If we assume that a law is passed and ED instantly stops issuing new Federal Student Aid money (grants, work-study, and loans), then there would be chaos in higher education. Many current students would need to drop out because they could not afford the price without aid. Other students might be able to transfer to cheaper schools, but for a lower-quality education. There would be significant pressure on schools to lower costs to what students could afford, though at the expense of quality. Some of the most expensive schools would not have to adjust much, however, since they already cater to wealthier students and have massive endowments built upon historical wealth. Harvard and Yale will be fine. But anyone who needs aid to attend a top-tier university will not be -- we'll return to a pre-1970s-ish time when college is only available to students whose families can and will help them financially to do so and it's not an option for everyone else.Private lenders will still be involved in the market, but that industry is not equipped to offset new loans that the government originates every year ([$75,556,035,663 in 2023-24]( and all of the current ills and risks of private student loans would remain. Some students would go for them, but it would still be largely those students whose families are financially secure enough to co-sign. The big policy idea of federal student loans was that the government would take on the risk of default, which would then open doors for lower-income students to succeed. Private lenders weren't taking that risk before and still won't today, effectively barring millions of Americans from higher education solely because they didn't grow up rich enough."
"Where is the Protecting Taxpayers from Wealthy Business Bailouts Act?By the way, if Biden's actions surrounding student loan forgiveness were illegal, why does Congress need to pass a bill forbidding it...?","Private student loans can also be discharged in bankruptcy. Though I expect you'll have significant difficulty getting a personal loan to refinance your student loan if the amount is at all substantial.You'd also lose the few perks available for private student loans, like the tax deduction on student loan interest and tax-free employer student loan repayment."
"It's not just student loans.Republicans are against so many safety net programs...SNAP and Medicaid, broadband and communication benefits, the Affordable Care Act protections for healthcare, etc. As bad as it was to give Trump the presidency I'm surprised voters would give republicans full control of government. They are going to make all of our lives more difficult.On the plus side,I think people will have massive buyers remorse by the midterms. Unfortunately a lot of damage can be done in two years with no checks or balances.",If the moneys wiped they can't reinstate irSUPREME COURT (bursting through the wall like the Kool Aid man): *We* decide what the president can't do!
"At this point I just hope the IDR adjustment hits before the new administration takes charge, otherwise I will lose years of payment history. Then after SAVE falls I will go back to IBR.","A court can't ""unvaccinate"" someone who has already gotten the jab. A court *could* say ""you still owe this money even though someone else said you don't."""
"If Trump did it, it would be funny to watch it suddenly become lawful. But alas, doing this would require motivation to help people, which unfortunately just isn't there.","i personally dont think they can get rid of things like saveGiven that all of SAVE has already been blocked by multiple court orders, this is one of the *easier* things an incoming administration could do. All that would need to happen is the new Department of Justice would dismiss its current appeals defending SAVE. The lower courts would then make their orders blocking the plan effective permanently and SAVE would be gone.Now, the SAVE regulation did a *lot* more than just create SAVE. And SAVE itself wasn't a new plan, it was revised rules for the existing REPAYE plan. So the specifics of what those court orders would do is uncertain -- would only the SAVE parts be blocked, or the entire regulation? Would SAVE revert to the old REPAYE rules or would REPAYE and SAVE both completely disappear? What would that mean for borrowers already on SAVE?We don't know, but I suspect that we're going to find out."
It's a nice thought. I hope you're right.,"At the moment, we don't know what ""adjustments"" the new Trump Administration will try to do. For something like undoing a Biden Administration policy that was implemented through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, the new Admin could just repeal it the same way, with a new notice-and-comment rule.More significant changes might require Congressional action or be blocked by courts, but it really depends on what the change is. It's usually much easier and simpler to revert to a prior system (even if it's broken) than to fix the system."
"I'm still waiting on the one-time account adjustment to hit. What are they waiting for? If this drags on into Trump administration I have zero confidence we will ever see it. Regardless of how anyone feels about student loan forgiveness, we should all at least be able to agree that restarting IDR payment counts from zero is completely and totally unfair.","Depends on how you define ""screwed"" I guess. I would expect there to be fewer avenues to getting forms of relief or forgiveness; and the paths that remain will likely be administratively harder to access.But it's not like the Administration can make your loans *worse* -- they're still governed by the contract you signed (the MPN). Your interest rate won't *increase* or anything crazy like that."
Sounds like concepts of a plan with no implementation. I'm seeing a pattern on the right.,
"For what it's worth, I'm about as pessimistic about republican policy as possible and I don't think IBR is getting changed. I wouldn't worry about that.",
Trump's plan to deport 20 million migrants via executive orders is estimated to cost upwards of a trillion dollars. It will be interesting to see if it faces any lawsuits and how SCOTUS responds to that with their *Major Questions Doctrine* or if we'll just see blind partisan hypocrisy.,
"There is only one IBR plan (Income-Based Repayment). You are likely referring to IDR (Income-Driven Repayment) which is terminology that comprises all of the plans based on income such as PAYE, REPAYE, SAVE, IBR, etc. I agree with your assessment that a Trump Department of Education will not process any IDR forgiveness.Even in the worst case I think IBR will survive in some form. Republicans had proposed changes to IBR that remove the forgiveness at the end but add an interest subsidy. However, it would have to pass Congress. I don't think that will happen. The more likely scenario is IBR stays as is, SAVE (and possibly PAYE, REPAYE and portions of ICR) all go down with the lawsuit and no forgiveness at all gets processed under Trump.Just my 2c.",
"This article is wrong that the lower interest rate wouldn't help people on income-driven plans. Those plans still accumulate interest at whatever rate you borrowed at, even if you have a $0 per month payment, so it would help.I think democrats would be on board with this if it's a clean bill with nothing else in it but I'm not sure how many Republicans would support it.",
"More than likely, or it just won't have enough support from other Republicans and will flop. I hope I'm wrong.",
"I agree with that and more, but with Republicans in charge we would be really lucky to get anything and 1% would definitely help a lot.",
