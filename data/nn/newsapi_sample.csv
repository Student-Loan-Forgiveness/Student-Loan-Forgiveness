https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/10/anna-delvey-conviction-felon-fraud-new-york-fashion-week-runway-ankle-monitor/,Right,"New York is publicly glamorizing convicted felons in a shocking new way.
Ex-con Anna Delvey was found guilty of 12 charges in 2019, including attempted first-degree larceny, after posing as a wealthy heiress to scam several socialites. She was sentenced to 12 years in state prison and ordered to pay approximately $199,000 in restitution, on top of facing a $24,000 fine. Instead of being shunned by society, Delvey unapologetically strutted her stuff on the runway Feb. 9, as part of New York Fashion Week. Her ankle monitor served as a fashion accessory as she opened the Elena Velez show.

New York Fashion Week is a display of luxurious haute-couture, worn by some of the world’s top models. The event is marketed as a collective who’s who of music, Hollywood, sports and fashion, and at some point down the line, someone thought Delvey qualified to make it to the top of this list.

Haven’t we all seen her live out her socialite dreams before? Indeed we have, when she was ripping people off and swindling big bucks from innocent victims. Delvey knowingly targeted New York’s elite with her elaborate scams, and has been under house arrest since 2021 after being released from immigration detention. She shouldn’t be turning heads on a runway, she should be kicked to the curb for her devious crimes.
Ah yes, the persistent glorification of people charged with crimes.

https://newrepublic.com/post/191363/trump-executive-order-bribery-foreign-officials-legal,Left,"Donald Trump plans to make it legal for businesses to bribe foreign officials.
Bloomberg reports that the president will soon sign an executive order to pause the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, claiming that it hurts American businesses. The order will instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to pause criminal prosecutions under the law until she issues new enforcement guidelines, according to a fact sheet on the order obtained by the news outlet. She will also be ordered to review current and past Justice Department actions under the law.
“U.S. companies are harmed by FCPA overenforcement because they are prohibited from engaging in practices common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field,” the fact sheet states. A White House official confirmed the fact sheet’s veracity to CNBC, telling the network the move is “a pause in enforcement to better understand how to streamline the FCPA to make sure it’s in line with economic interests and national security.”
The FCPA, passed in 1977, specifically prohibits any person or company tied to the United States from paying money or offering gifts to foreign officials to help their business. In 1998, the law was amended to include foreign businesses, as well as people who facilitated such bribes in the U.S. The DOJ said there were 24 cases related to alleged violations of the law in 2024, and 17 in 2023.
This new order is a continuation from Trump’s first term, when he considered getting rid of the FCPA and called it a “horrible law.” It’s quite clear why Trump would seek to get rid of or soften the law. During his first term, he often looked the other way on possible illegal bribes and let American oil and gas companies keep their under-the-table payments to dictators of countries like Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan secret, a practice that even Russian oil companies don’t engage in.
Trump may benefit personally from weakening or discarding the FCPA. The Trump Organization announced last month that it will no longer prohibit deals with foreign companies while he is president, and he might seek to “grease the wheels” on overseas deals without any restrictions.
The president’s family is also trying to reclaim the lease on their former hotel in Washington, D.C.—a hotbed of corruption, where foreign governments spent more than $750,000 during his first term. It looks like Trump is opening the doors for American companies and individuals, including himself, to pay off foreign officials to better line their pockets.",donald trump plan make legal business bribe foreign official bloomberg report president soon sign executive order pause enforcement foreign corrupt practice act claiming hurt american business order instruct attorney general pam bondi pause criminal prosecution law issue new enforcement guideline according fact sheet order obtained news outlet ordered review current past justice department action law company harmed fcpa overenforcement prohibited engaging practice common international competitor creating uneven playing field fact sheet state white house official confirmed fact sheet veracity cnbc telling network pause enforcement better understand streamline fcpa make sure line economic interest national security fcpa passed specifically prohibits person company tied united state paying money offering gift foreign official help business law amended include foreign business people facilitated bribe doj said case related alleged violation law new order continuation trump term considered getting rid fcpa called horrible law quite clear trump seek rid soften law term looked way possible illegal bribe let american oil gas company table payment dictator country like azerbaijan kazakhstan secret practice russian oil company engage trump benefit personally weakening discarding fcpa trump organization announced month longer prohibit deal foreign company president seek grease wheel overseas deal restriction president family trying reclaim lease hotel washington hotbed corruption foreign government spent term look like trump opening door american company individual including pay foreign official better line pocket
https://hollywoodlife.com/2025/02/04/what-happens-if-department-of-education-is-abolished/,,"Now that Donald Trump is president again, the Republican intends to implement some changes in the federal workforce — including in the United States Department of Education. After winning the 2024 election, the 78-year-old vowed he would “move education back to the states” and that he wanted to “drain the government education swamp.” According to new reports, Trump plans to make significant employment cuts from the department, but does this mean a complete abolishment?
Learn what Trump said about his plans for the Department of Education and whether or not a dismantling of the department is possible.
“During Career and Technical Education Month, we reaffirm our belief in excellence by putting America first and investing in the best training and retraining opportunities that will result in a stronger workforce and a booming economy.” — @POTUS
America is back! 🇺🇸
— U.S. Department of Education (@usedgov) February 3, 2025
The cabinet-level department focuses on promoting “student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access for students of all ages,” according to its official website.
Per several outlets, the Department of Education employs around 4,400 workers. It’s unclear how much that number could change under Trump’s administration as it implements staffing changes. Earlier this year, the White House announced a change to the federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) workforce.
Technically, a president can’t fully dismantle the Department of Education because it was created by an act of Congress. Therefore, Congress would need to move forward with eliminating the department.
As previously mentioned, a president can’t simply abolish the Department of Education; Congress would have to step in to move this forward. According to U.S. News, experts claim that dissolving the department would not have heavy impacts on certain programs or funding, such as pell grants and federal student loans.
Though Trump previously stated his intention to move the responsibility of education to the states, the Department of Education’s website indicates that education is, in fact, a state and local responsibility across the U.S. The department also states that 92 percent of funds for elementary and secondary education originates from the states, while just 8 percent is from the federal level.",donald trump president republican intends implement change federal workforce including united state department education winning election year old vowed education state wanted drain government education swamp according new report trump plan make significant employment cut department doe mean complete abolishment learn trump said plan department education dismantling department possible career technical education month reaffirm belief excellence putting america investing best training retraining opportunity result stronger workforce booming economy potus america department education february cabinet level department focus promoting student achievement preparation global competitiveness fostering educational excellence ensuring equal access student age according official website outlet department education employ worker unclear number change trump administration implement staffing change earlier year white house announced change federal diversity equity inclusion dei workforce technically president ca fully dismantle department education created act congress congress need forward eliminating department previously mentioned president ca simply abolish department education congress step forward according news expert claim dissolving department heavy impact certain program funding pell grant federal student loan trump previously stated intention responsibility education state department education website indicates education fact state local responsibility department state percent fund elementary secondary education originates state just percent federal level

https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/05/nyt-accuses-trump-power-grab-while-completely-ignoring-bidens-executive-overreach/,Right,"The New York Times on Wednesday published an article headlined “Trump Brazenly Defies Laws in Escalating Executive Power Grab,” criticizing President Donald Trump’s use of executive authority while ignoring questionable actions by former President Joe Biden.
The article, written by NYT reporter Charlie Savage, outlines the ways in which Trump allegedly disregarded legal restrictions, including citing his policies on TikTok, asylum seekers and executive firings. However, it fails to reference a single example of the Biden administration’s numerous actions that faced legal challenges. (RELATED: Companies, Business Groups Have Plans To Push Back On Biden’s Vaccine Mandate)

— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) June 5, 2020
“Other presidents have occasionally ignored or claimed a right to bypass particular statutes,” Savage wrote. “But Mr. Trump has opened the throttle on defying legal limits.”
“Mr. Trump has effectively nullified laws, such as by ordering the Justice Department to refrain from enforcing a ban on the wildly popular app TikTok and by blocking migrants from invoking a statute allowing them to request asylum,” he added. “He moved to effectively shutter a federal agency Congress created and tried to freeze congressionally approved spending, including most foreign aid. He summarily fired prosecutors, inspectors general and board members of independent agencies in defiance of legal rules against arbitrary removal.”
Biden, during his presidency, imposed vaccine mandates, pressured social media platforms to censor content, attempted to implement a student loan forgiveness plan that was ruled unconstitutional and unilaterally declared that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) had become law despite lacking congressional approval.
Biden in December 2020 pledged not to impose a COVID-19 vaccine mandate once he became president, but issued multiple mandates upon taking office.
His administration required federal employees and contractors to get vaccinated or tested for the virus and also imposed a vaccine-or-testing rule for private businesses with more than 100 employees. The Supreme Court struck down the private sector mandate in January 2022.
Under the Biden administration, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin required service members to take the COVID-19 vaccine, discharging over 8,000 service members for refusing. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 to reinstate them, restoring them to their prior rank with full back pay and benefits.
The Biden administration also pushed Big Tech companies to restrict content during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, it pressured Facebook to censor posts regarding the pandemic that it deemed misinformation, according to documents published by House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan in July 2023.
Judge Terry A. Doughty of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued an injunction on July 4, 2023, ruling that the Biden administration likely breached the First Amendment when it collaborated with social media platforms to censor information it opposed.
Doughty described the censorship as “Orwellian,” stating that Republican attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri “produced evidence of a massive effort by Defendants, from the White House to federal agencies, to suppress speech based on its content.”
Biden’s White House also influenced Amazon in March 2021 to restrict the visibility of books that expressed skepticism regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, according to emails the House Judiciary Committee obtained.
Moreover, although the Supreme Court ruled against the Biden administration’s efforts to forgive student debt in June 2023, his administration continued to press ahead with student forgiveness schemes until the very end of his presidency. In total, the administration forgave over $180 billion in student loan debt affecting more than 5 million borrowers.
The former president also published a statement on Jan. 17 unilaterally declaring that the ERA “has become part of our Constitution.” He asserted that as of 2020, 38 states ratified the amendment and that it should now be recognized as “the law of the land.”
Congress passed the ERA in 1972, but the amendment failed to be ratified by the required three-quarters of states within the seven-year deadline.
“Today, I affirm the Equal Rights Amendment to have cleared all the necessary hurdles to be added to the U.S. Constitution now,” Biden said at a press conference on Jan. 17. “The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land now. It’s the 28th Amendment to the Constitution, now!”
Although presidents have the authority to issue pardons, Biden received blowback from both parties for the sweeping pardons he issued to his son Hunter and other members of his family in the final days of his presidency. He also criticized Trump in December 2020 over reports that claimed Trump was considering pardoning his family members.
“It concerns me, in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,” Biden said during the CNN interview.

https://www.commondreams.org/news/trump-tax-rich-people,Left,"The Republican Party is intent on permanently extending the 2017 tax cuts which primarily benefited the wealthiest earners and corporations—a priority that would cost an estimated $4.6 trillion and which has sent lawmakers searching for potential spending offsets including cuts to Medicare, food assistance, and renewable energy programs.
But polling released Tuesday suggested the GOP is likely to face widespread outcry—and potential opposition from vulnerable Republicans who don't want to risk angering voters—as a majority of Americans are vehemently opposed to paying for tax cuts for the wealthy by slashing public programs.
The new poll, taken by Data for Progress on behalf of the progressive advocacy groups Groundwork Collaborative and the Student Borrower Protection Center, found that although Republican lawmakers have demonized efforts to provide relief to student loan borrowers, the party's potential overhaul of the income-based repayment program isn't popular among voters of any political ideology.
Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they don't want the repayment plan eliminated, including 56% of Republican voters and 70% of Independents who said they oppose funding cuts for federal student loans and grants.
The GOP's plan would save an estimated $127.3 billion over 10 years by forcing the average student loan borrower to pay nearly $200 more per month.
""Most people don't have an extra $200 a month to throw toward their student loan bill,"" Michele Shepard Zampini, senior director of college affordability at the Institute for College Access & Success, toldCNBC on Monday.
""Voters overwhelmingly reject efforts to cut critical supports that working families rely on.""
Despite that fact, said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director for the Student Borrower Protection Center, the GOP's budget proposals would ""cut taxes for their billionaire buddies by raiding the pockets of Americans with student debt and families already struggling to pay for college.""
""This polling makes it crystal clear,"" she said. ""Voters overwhelmingly reject efforts to cut critical supports that working families rely on.""
Republicans can also expect to see pushback if they attempt cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, the survey found. Ninety percent of respondents said they want Medicare funding to increase or remain the same; 87% said the same for Medicaid. Republicans are planning to unveil the first-ever work requirements for Medicaid, which provides healthcare coverage for low-income people and those with disabilities, in an upcoming budget bill.
As Politicoreported Sunday, Republican lawmakers are ""increasingly alarmed"" that Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), chair of the House Budget Committee, ""keeps raising Medicare reforms as a potential spending offset.""
More than 80% of respondents also don't want Republicans to make cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which the GOP is also planning to make subject to expanded work requirements.
Those who want funding for SNAP to increase or stay the same include 67% of Republicans and 75% of Independents.
The polling may leave Republican leaders wondering what programs they will be able to cut without facing outcry from angry voters who rely on public services—but Elizabeth Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy for Groundwork Collaborative, suggested in a statement Tuesday that the answer is simple: The GOP must abandon its plan to dole out more tax breaks for the rich.
""Voters are clear about what they want: Lower prices, better jobs, vital programs protected and expanded, and for the wealthy to pay their fair share in taxes,"" said Pancotti. ""And yet, Republicans in both chambers of Congress are working overtime to achieve the exact opposite.""
President Donald Trump has called on the GOP to advance his taxation, immigration, and energy agenda in ""one big, beautiful bill,"" while Senate Republican leaders have begun work on two separate bills, with taxes dealt with later in the year.
""Whether one bill or two,"" said Pancotti, ""House and Senate GOP members are aligned on wanting to cut lifesaving programs in order to enrich their billionaire friends and donors, and voters are taking note.""",republican party intent permanently extending tax cut primarily benefited wealthiest earner corporation priority cost estimated trillion sent lawmaker searching potential spending offset including cut medicare food assistance renewable energy program polling released tuesday suggested gop likely face widespread outcry potential opposition vulnerable republican want risk angering voter majority american vehemently opposed paying tax cut wealthy slashing public program new poll taken data progress behalf progressive advocacy group groundwork collaborative student borrower protection center republican lawmaker demonized effort provide relief student loan borrower party potential overhaul income based repayment program popular voter political ideology nearly third respondent said want repayment plan eliminated including republican voter independent said oppose funding cut federal student loan grant gop plan save estimated billion year forcing average student loan borrower pay nearly month people extra month throw student loan michele shepard zampini senior director college affordability institute college access success toldcnbc monday voter overwhelmingly reject effort cut critical support working family rely despite fact said aissa canchola banez policy director student borrower protection center gop budget proposal cut tax billionaire buddy raiding pocket american student debt family struggling pay college polling make crystal clear said voter overwhelmingly reject effort cut critical support working family rely republican expect pushback attempt cut medicare medicaid survey ninety percent respondent said want medicare funding increase remain said medicaid republican planning unveil work requirement medicaid provides healthcare coverage low income people disability upcoming budget politicoreported sunday republican lawmaker increasingly alarmed rep jodey arrington texas chair house budget committee keep raising medicare reform potential spending offset respondent want republican make cut supplemental nutrition assistance program snap commonly known food stamp gop planning make subject expanded work requirement want funding snap increase stay include republican independent polling leave republican leader wondering program able cut facing outcry angry voter rely public service elizabeth pancotti managing director policy advocacy groundwork collaborative suggested statement tuesday answer simple gop abandon plan dole tax break rich voter clear want lower price better job vital program protected expanded wealthy pay fair share tax said pancotti republican chamber congress working overtime achieve exact opposite president donald trump called gop advance taxation immigration energy agenda big beautiful senate republican leader begun work separate bill tax dealt later year said pancotti house senate gop member aligned wanting cut lifesaving program order enrich billionaire friend donor voter taking note

[+] House on December 16, 2024, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jim WATSON / AFP) (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)
The Department of Education, under the Biden Administration, confirmed this week that the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) Plans are re-opened for enrollments, with some restrictions due to the ongoing lawsuits.
In updated guidance shared this week, the Department of Education confirms: “As of December 16, 2024 borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans: Pay As You Earn (PAYE), SAVE (previously known as REPAYE), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.”
However, not all features of the plans may be in effect because of the lawsuits.
The PAYE and ICR plans were originally closed to new enrollment on June 30, 2024 due to the advent of the new SAVE plan. However, when the SAVE plan was put on hold by the courts, the Department of Education issued rules to re-open the PAYE and ICR plans for borrowers who may want to select these options.
The PAYE student loan repayment plan caps your monthly student loan payment at 10% of your discretionary income, which is set at 150% of the poverty guidelines. PAYE also provides loan forgiveness after borrowers are enrolled in the plan for 20 years. However, to qualify, borrowers must have a partial financial hardship, meaning that the PAYE payment would be lower than what they would pay under the Standard 10-year Repayment Plan.
The ICR student loan repayment plan is not as generous, as it caps your monthly student loan payment at the lesser of 20% of your discretionary income or what your payment would be on a fixed 12-year payment plan, after you adjust it for income. However, discretionary income under this plan is calculated at 100% of your state’s poverty guideline. Forgiveness on ICR takes up to 25 years.
The Department of Education confirmed that student loan servicers (like MOHELA and Aidvantage) are processing student loan repayment plan requests. According to the updated statement, “In the coming weeks, the Department expects servicers to begin processing certain IDR applications that were paused following court orders affecting the terms and availability of IDR plans.”
They also confirmed that “Servicers will also process applications for recalculations for IBR, ICR, and PAYE. Servicers will have applications in the queue that will take some time to work through.”
However, according to reports from borrowers on Reddit, loan servicers are estimating the backlog of repayment plan applications could take upwards of 8 weeks or more to process.
According to the Department of Education, “If servicers need time to process a borrower’s IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance is eligible for PSLF and IDR forgiveness. If the borrower’s application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. “
It’s important to note that loan forgiveness under PAYE and ICR is currently blocked, just like any SAVE loan forgiveness. Only loan forgiveness for borrowers under the Income Based Repayment (IBR) plan is currently being processed, since this program was enacted separately by Congress.
However, for borrowers who reach the loan forgiveness time milestones under these plans, the Department of Education has announced that borrowers would move to an interest-free forbearance while they wait.
“Borrowers who reach their plan’s repayment milestone—that is, 25 years in repayment for borrowers on any of these plans or 20 years for borrowers in PAYE or undergraduate-only borrowers in SAVE—will be moved into an interest-free forbearance, if they are not already in a forbearance as a result of the litigation.”
With these latest updates in mind, should borrowers consider switching to PAYE or ICR if they qualify? For most borrowers under the SAVE litigation forbearance, the answer is no.
Since borrowers on the SAVE litigation hold are in an interest-free forbearance, there are no payments due and no interest is accruing. Borrowers should, instead, be using this time to improve their finances, save their estimated payments, and plan for what payments could look like when they resume.
However, for borrowers who are close to achieving loan forgiveness under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), there may be opportunities under these plans to achieve your loan forgiveness milestone of 120 payments. For borrowers close to the 120 payment mark (say, within 5-6 months of payments), switching payment plans may get you to the 120 mark quicker than waiting for the SAVE litigation to resolve.
The other option is PSLF Buy Back, which will allow borrowers to buy back missing PSLF credits once they reach 120, but this program is currently difficult to navigate and requires a borrower to hit the 120 milestone before taking action.
The Buy Back may be a better option for borrowers who have less than 100 payments credited towards PSLF.",president joe biden speaks hanukkah holiday reception east room white house december washington dc photo jim watson afp photo jim watson afp getty image department education biden administration confirmed week pay earn paye income contingent repayment icr plan opened enrollment restriction ongoing lawsuit updated guidance shared week department education confirms december borrower apply following idr plan pay earn paye save previously known repaye income based repayment ibr income contingent repayment icr borrower meet plan specific eligibility requirement feature plan effect lawsuit paye icr plan originally closed new enrollment june advent new save plan save plan hold court department education issued rule open paye icr plan borrower want select option paye student loan repayment plan cap monthly student loan payment discretionary income set poverty guideline paye provides loan forgiveness borrower enrolled plan year qualify borrower partial financial hardship meaning paye payment lower pay standard year repayment plan icr student loan repayment plan generous cap monthly student loan payment lesser discretionary income payment fixed year payment plan adjust income discretionary income plan calculated state poverty guideline forgiveness icr take year department education confirmed student loan servicers like mohela aidvantage processing student loan repayment plan request according updated statement coming week department expects servicers begin processing certain idr application paused following court order affecting term availability idr plan confirmed servicers process application recalculation ibr icr paye servicers application queue time work according report borrower reddit loan servicers estimating backlog repayment plan application upwards week process according department education servicers need time process borrower idr application servicers borrower processing forbearance day accrues short term processing forbearance time processing forbearance eligible pslf idr forgiveness borrower application processed servicer day borrower moved general forbearance doe count pslf idr application processed accrue general forbearance important note loan forgiveness paye icr currently blocked just like save loan forgiveness loan forgiveness borrower income based repayment ibr plan currently processed program enacted separately congress borrower reach loan forgiveness time milestone plan department education announced borrower free forbearance wait borrower reach plan repayment milestone year repayment borrower plan year borrower paye undergraduate borrower save moved free forbearance forbearance result litigation latest update mind borrower consider switching paye icr qualify borrower save litigation forbearance answer borrower save litigation hold free forbearance payment accruing borrower instead using time improve finance save estimated payment plan payment look like resume borrower close achieving loan forgiveness public service loan forgiveness pslf opportunity plan achieve loan forgiveness milestone payment borrower close payment mark say month payment switching payment plan mark quicker waiting save litigation resolve option pslf buy allow borrower buy missing pslf credit reach program currently difficult navigate requires borrower hit milestone taking action buy better option borrower payment credited pslf
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-investor-elon-musk-is-working-more-for-trump-and-less-for-tesla-154454531.html,Lean Left,"Elon Musk is Tesla (TSLA) CEO in title only nowadays and is keener on wielding power in the incoming Trump administration, one outspoken investor in the electric vehicle maker contended.
""[Elon Musk] certainly is setting the direction and the tone of the business and overseeing the senior executives that are in charge of all the different projects, but in the traditional sense of running a company, like what's going on in Nvidia [and CEO Jensen Huang], no, I mean, he's not at all,"" Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management president Ross Gerber said on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts (video above).
""I think Tesla shareholders are more than aware that their CEO works for Donald Trump at this point,"" Gerber added.
The bromance between Musk and President-elect Donald Trump has been on full display for months.
Trump and Musk have publicly praised each other, and the latter has donated at least $132 million to Trump's and other Republicans' campaigns.
For his public support, Trump awarded Musk a role in his administration alongside another ardent supporter, Vivek Ramaswamy, as the head of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Musk has been spending considerable time at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, meeting with world leaders and advising Trump. He even interjected himself into a contentious debt ceiling debate this month, which almost led to a government shutdown.

Nevertheless, the market has rallied since Trump's November presidential win, particularly sectors that are seen as beneficiaries of his policies. Though the president-elect has not been a fan of green energy and may withdraw the $7,500 EV credit created under the Biden administration, Tesla may be in a favorable position due to its CEO's connection with Trump.
Tesla stock rose over 1% on Tuesday in premarket trading. Shares have surged 74% since Election Day, outpacing the S&P 500's nearly 5% gain.
Gerber believes 2025 will prove critical for Tesla and Musk's preoccupation with the Trump administration means the wider Tesla team must step it up. Only three people are listed as executive team members on Tesla's investor relations page: Musk, new senior automotive vice president Tom Zhu, and new CFO Vaibhav Taneja.
If not, the stock could be penalized amid signs that execution isn't first-rate enough to justify Tesla's heady valuation.
""It's yet to be seen whether this [Tesla] team can prove themselves,"" Gerber said. ""The old team at Tesla, which I knew very well, was very capable, but they were all let go in the last year. So a whole new team has taken the reins here, and 2025 is going to be their year to prove if they can deliver because they got a lot of stuff to deliver in the next 12 to 18 months.""
Gerber is a longtime Tesla shareholder and was once an ardent supporter of the company.
However, he began to cut his stake in Tesla in 2023 due to valuation concerns and Musk risks. Tesla is now just under 2% of his firm's portfolio.
Gerber believes Tesla's fair value is around $200 a share, or 52% below current price levels. The average sell-side price target on Tesla is $283, according to Yahoo Finance data.
Musk and Tesla still have their supporters on Wall Street, however.
At the Yahoo Finance Invest conference, Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik said that the world's continued transition to renewable energy and Musk’s relationship with Trump were two catalysts for Tesla.
“For the long term, it has a lot of growth trajectory in front of it,” she said.
And Wedbush analyst Dan Ives made Tesla his top pick for 2025.
""I think by 2026 you'll see cybercabs,"" Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (listen below). ""Tesla is not a car company. More and more, it's not going to be valued as a traditional EV maker. It's about the autonomous future. We think autonomous [industry] is worth a trillion dollars alone.""

https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/trump-expected-to-pardon-blagojevich/,Lean Left,"CHICAGO (CBS) — President Trump officially issued a pardon to former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich Monday, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. The development was first reported by Axios.
""It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people — some of the same people that I had to deal with. He wasn't quite as successful, but he had somebody that saw what was going on. I didn't know him, other than I believe he was on 'The Apprentice' for a little while,"" said President Trump. ""He was just a very nice person. He had a fantastic wife. She fought like hell to get him out. He was given a sentence of like 18 years [sic], and it was a terrible injustice. They just were after him. They go after a lot of people.""
Blagojevich was originally sentenced to 14 years in prison in December 2011 on 18 corruption charges, including attempting to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat after Obama won the White House in 2008. Blagojevich only served nearly eight years before being commuted in February 2020 during Mr. Trump's first presidency.
Upon his release from prison, he told CBS Chicago that he believed he ""was sent to prison for practicing politics,"" but also admitted to having made ""mistakes.""
Legally, a pardon goes further than a sentence commutation. A pardon is official forgiveness — with all the rights lost by a convicted felon being restored with a pardon.
Speaking Monday evening outside his home in Chicago's Ravenswood Manor neighborhood, Blagojevich expressed his ""deepest and most profound and everlasting gratitude"" to President Trump.
""I think about my relationship with President Trump, and it's really—well, he's always doing things for me, and he never asks me to do anything for him. I had a chance to be on his television show, and he ended what was a long, long, hard nightmare, after 2,986 days in prison — nearly eight years — President Trump pulled me out of there,"" Blagojevich said, ""and now he did this. And all I can tell you is that President Trump is a man who when he sees things that are wrong, he rights them. He puts an end to them.""
Blagojevich maintained that he never broke any laws.
""I never took a penny. It was all politics — routine political conversations that were begun by then-President-elect Obama, who sent an emissary to me to talk about making what the appellate court called a routine political deal when they reversed the so-called sale of the Senate seat,"" Blagojevich said. ""They were fake charges, and the big lie was told by the prosecutor and his office that did to me and my family what they did.""
Blagojevich also compared his own plight to that of President Trump, who was convicted in New York in May of last year on 34 charges in a scheme to influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn star. In January, two months after being elected to a new term, Mr. Trump received an unconditional discharge — meaning he would face no penalties.
""His resilience, his strength, his fortitude, his unwillingness to give in, is an inspiration and an example of the kind of leader that he is,"" Blagojevich said. ""I could never give in. I want to say to the people of Illinois two things. Number one, I never raised your taxes, and number two, I didn't do it. It was all political talk.""
Blagojevich said he first learned of the pardon two weeks ago while at home with his wife, Patti. The former governor said President Trump called him and told him what would be happening this present Monday.
Months after his release, Blagojevich filed a federal lawsuit claiming his removal from office by the Illinois Senate following his 2009 impeachment trial was unconstitutional and sought the ability to run for state or local elected office in Illinois.
In 2024, a judge issued a ruling in Blagojevich's filed lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban on him running for state or local office. The judge's ruling utilized allusions to Dr. Seuss to underline their message.
""Read generally Dr. Seuss, Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now! (1972) ('The time has come. The time has come. The time is now. Just Go. Go. GO! I don't care how. You can go by foot. You can go by cow. Marvin K. Mooney, will you please go now!'),"" U.S. District Judge Steven Seeger wrote.
Blagojevich and Mr. Trump have worked together in the past. He appeared in Season 3 of the reality competition show ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" in which he was ""fired"" by Mr. Trump during the season's run.
In fact, Blagojevich mentioned Mr. Trump — then not yet president or a presidential candidate — in the hours before reporting to prison in 2012.
""I got fired by Donald Trump,"" Blagojevich said at the time. ""This thing I've got to do now is worse.""
The news of the pardon sets in motion a possible political revival. While Blagojevich remains barred from holding elected office in Illinois after his impeachment from office, there has been word lately he could be named ambassador to Serbia in the new Trump White House.
In 1999, Blagojevich, who has Serbian roots, joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson as Jackson helped broker the release of three American prisoners in Serbia. Blagojevich was a U.S. congressman at the time.
Now, 26 years and a political lifetime later, speculation has been that Blagojevich may be dispatched back to the region of his ancestors by the very man who released him from prison early — as the Rod Blagojevich story takes another unexpected turn.
When asked in the Oval Office whether he was considering Blagojevich for ambassador to Serbia, President Trump said: ""No, but I would. He's now cleaner than anybody in this room.""
Blagojevich declined to comment Monday night on the speculation about the ambassadorship.
The political land mines Blagojevich faced resemble much of Trump's political career. Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Blagojevich, represented former FBI Director James Comey, whom President Trump fired from the agency in 2017.
Comey was working in the private sector during the Blagojevich investigation and indictment.
Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who oversaw the investigation into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, was FBI director during the investigation into Blagojevich.
What the pardon means for Blagojevich's electability moving forward remained unclear late Monday.
Blagojevich himself is excited and pleased with the pardon. But other politicians from Illinois do not see it that way.
""I strongly disagree with President Donald Trump's decision to pardon disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich,"" Illinois Senate Republican Leader John Curran (R-Lemont) said in a news release. ""Illinois taxpayers have and continue to be burdened with the cost of public corruption, and this pardon sends the wrong message.""
U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) issued a statement denouncing the pardon: ""In a state with more than its fair share of public corruption, the Blagojevich chapter still looms as one of the worst. America and Serbia deserve better.""
Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza also issued a statement, pointing out that Blagojevich was also convicted of trying to shake down Children's Memorial Hospital — the predecessor to Lurie Children's Hospital:
""President Trump has the power as president to pardon whomever he wants.
The president can pardon someone as unworthy as Rod Blagojevich, who threatened to hold up funds from a children's hospital unless the hospital's CEO donated to his campaign. That was my bill to fund treatment for sick children that Blagojevich held up.
""Long before it was fashionable to criticize the governor of my own party, I was a lonely voice calling for Blagojevich's impeachment. I stand by my remarks on the floor of the House during his impeachment after I co-sponsored the bill to launch the impeachment committee against Blagojevich:
""'It's amazingly fitting that Governor Blagojevich face impeachment today of all days on his self-admitted hero Richard Nixon's birthday. Their common bond of impeachment will unite them in history's dark annals of corruption. But even Nixon displayed more integrity than Blagojevich by resigning before he was impeached.'
""'I sponsored House Bill 5331 that would have provided $8 million for specialty care pediatricians in Illinois. Those sick children, Governor, they're still waiting. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that Governor Blagojevich would have pulled back funds for sick children in order to extort the president of the children's hospital.'
""A pardon does not erase his crimes from the memory of many Illinoisans whose trust he violated and it never will.""

While it’s hard to keep track of all the different scams Americans have to deal with in their everyday lives, the Federal Trade Commission has revealed that total losses to fraud nationwide topped more than $10 billion in 2023. Final fraud statistics for 2024 aren't quite out yet, but FTC data shows some alarming trends in terms of the types of scams that are out there.
For example, online job scams were huge in 2024, as well as employment scams taking place via text. Other popular scams last year involved criminals impersonating government officials, gift card scams, phishing scams, charity scams and the always-popular business and investment scams.
Student loan scams have also run rampant over the last few years, especially since there’s been so much uncertainty when it comes to potential forgiveness plans for federal student loans. While the Biden administration tried to forgive millions of dollars in student loan debt and was successful at forgiving student debt for more than 5 million borrowers, the changing headlines have been downright confusing.
Not only did several of former President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plans get struck down by the courts, but the same thing may happen to the Saving On a Valuable Education income-driven repayment plan. The fate of this repayment plan still hangs in the balance to this day as borrowers await a decision from the courts on the legality of the plan.
All of this has paved the way for scammers to jump right in with brand new student loan scams that prey on borrowers who are desperate to have their loans forgiven. Here are some of the newest and most common student loan scams to watch out for in 2025.
Student loan forgiveness scams come in several different forms, but they’re all built around the fact it's so hard to keep up with the headlines these days.
Essentially, scammers reach out to people with student loan debt and promise them help getting their loans forgiven, either through traditional government forgiveness plans or other sources of debt relief.
Of course, the assistance is entirely fake and the criminals are usually trying to get their hands on the borrower's sensitive personal information in order to steal their identities.
Some student loan forgiveness scams are phishing scams, where they send out a fake email or text with the goal of getting you to voluntarily share information like your full name, address, and Social Security number. Other scams exist to get your federal student loan login information, which can lead to criminals locking you out of your account completely, stealing your identity or both.
There are companies out there promising loan forgiveness assistance and other types of debt relief in exchange for upfront fees. Unfortunately, they can’t actually deliver on the promise of student loan forgiveness, but they'll still take your money and pretend to help you until you realize it's all a ruse.
It’s important to note that there isn’t anything a private company can do that you cannot do yourself for free. And if you do need help, you can always contact your student loan servicer.
The U.S. Department of Education also says that, in some cases, these companies will ask you to send them your student loan payment so they can pay your bills on your behalf. Of course, they will never make your student loan payments since their whole plan is pocketing your money instead.
Scams that have to do with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid tend to morph over time, although they typically involve a company promising to help families secure financial aid for higher education. In any case, the scammer is trying to:
Regardless of the goal of the scam, the Department of Education says that you should never pay for help with the FAFSA since you can get it for free through the the financial aid office at your college or schools you’re thinking about attending, the FAFSA form’s online help page, or the Federal Student Aid Information Center.
There are some telltale signs that should alert you when something’s not right with a student loan program.

https://decrypt.co/303054/sofi-ceo-details-aggressive-crypto-return-under-president-trump,,"San Francisco-headquartered SoFi Technologies signaled Monday it would soon dive back into crypto following expectations the SEC would begin to clarify crypto rules under its new leadership.
While the firm once offered its customers the ability to trade 20 digital assets in the U.S.—including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin—the company called it quits in 2023, winding the service down after “careful consideration,” according to a statement at the time.
The company’s return will hinge on the regulatory clarity brought about under President Donald Trump’s administration, SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said during a Monday earnings call.
“We hope the administration and the regulators come up with clarity on what the outlook will be,” he said. “We will move as aggressively as anyone else once that is determined.”
SoFi’s crypto services could look vastly different for its 10 million customers than before, Noto said. Depending on how the regulatory picture shakes out, he said everything from digital asset custody to clearing and asset-backed lending—a program that Coinbase restarted this month—may be on the table.
“As the regulation changes, we will be incredibly aggressively tied to crypto and be in as many businesses that we can be across the entire platform,” he said.
As a financial services company, SoFi offers customers various products, from student loans to debit cards.
Bolstering its investment platform with crypto in 2019, the move mirrored Silicon Valley startups like Robinhood that were also expanding into the space.
Noto’s declaration comes not long after SEC's acting chairman, Mark Uyeda, said that the agency could “do better.” Last week, the Commission unveiled a task force to regulate crypto without reliance on enforcement actions, mirroring one of Trump’s campaign promises.
Following the collapse of FTX in 2022, the SEC engaged in what advocates described as a regulatory onslaught. After Robinhood received an enforcement threat from the SEC, Vlad Tenev decried the SEC’s approach to the crypto space last year as an “improper attempt by the administrative state to stifle innovation.”
SoFi has tried to differentiate its investment services by making its platform a “one-stop shop,” and customers signaled in 2018 that crypto fits with that strategy, Noto said.
While SoFi shuttered its crypto services in 2023, the company has expanded its investment offerings elsewhere. ​​SoFi launched its alternative investment platform in early 2024, allowing customers to access assets like the Japanese yen and gold.
In 2023, most of SoFi’s customers were given less than a month’s notice before their crypto funds were liquidated and deposited into their brokerage accounts. At the same time, SoFi users could migrate their crypto holdings to a new account at Blockchain.com.
SoFi did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/us-news/president-trump-lays-out-goal-for-education-secretary-i-want-her-to-put-herself-out-of-a-job/,Lean Right,"Her job is to end her job.
President Trump reiterated that his top objective for Department of Education secretary nominee Linda McMahon is for her to bring about the elimination of the position altogether.
“I told Linda — ‘Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job,'” Trump, 78, recounted to reporters Tuesday. “I want her to put herself out of a job [in the] Education Department.”
The president was asked about how he squares picking McMahon, 76, to helm the Education Department with his push to eliminate the department outright.
McMahon, who served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term, has publicly echoed his goal of abolishing the department.
Trump is rumored to be contemplating executive action to that end, but critics in the legal realm argue he would need to go through Congress in order to achieve that.
“I think I’d work with Congress,” Trump said about ending the Department of Education. “We’d have to work with the teachers union because the teachers union is the only one that’s opposed to it.”
“We have to tell the teachers union we’re rated last in the world in education of the top 40.”
It is not immediately clear which rating system Trump was referencing.
Conservatives have long sought to get rid of the Education Department, which was created in 1979 under late former President Jimmy Carter. Former President Ronald Reagan had also backed eliminating the department.
The Department of Education had $241.66 billion in budgetary resources last fiscal year, according to data from USASpending.gov.
The bulk of those budgetary resources — about $180 billion — went to the Office of Federal Student Aid, which deals with student loans.
Trump said he would prefer to return power from the department back to the states, which he argued are better suited to manage their own education systems.
“I think that if you moved our schools into some of these states that are really well-run states, they would be as good as Denmark and Norway and Sweden,” Trump said. “But you’d have the laggards, the same laggards that are laggards with everything else, including crime.”
Thus far into his second administration, Trump has championed efforts to slim down the federal government and reduce its footprint.
He has tapped tech guru Elon Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which despite its name is not actually a government department but rather a temporary government organization.
Via DOGE, Musk has begun taking aim at various government agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as part of his efforts to root out bloat.",job end job president trump reiterated objective department education secretary nominee linda mcmahon bring elimination position altogether told linda linda hope great job job trump recounted reporter tuesday want job education department president asked square picking mcmahon helm education department push eliminate department outright mcmahon served administrator small business administration trump term publicly echoed goal abolishing department trump rumored contemplating executive action end critic legal realm argue need congress order achieve think work congress trump said ending department education work teacher union teacher union opposed tell teacher union rated world education immediately clear rating trump referencing conservative long sought rid education department created late president jimmy carter president ronald reagan backed eliminating department department education billion budgetary resource fiscal year according data usaspending gov bulk budgetary resource billion went office federal student aid deal student loan trump said prefer return power department state argued better suited manage education system think moved school state really run state good denmark norway sweden trump said laggard laggard laggard including crime far second administration trump championed effort slim federal government reduce footprint tapped tech guru elon musk lead department government efficiency doge despite actually government department temporary government organization doge musk begun taking aim various government agency agency international development usaid effort root bloat

Carlos Favian Martinez, the relative of notorious Gulf Cartel boss Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, pleaded guilty in a Houston federal courtroom to charges including price-fixing, extortion and money laundering, according to the AP. Martinez was among 10 people indicted in November 2022 in connection with an operation that used intimidation and violence to monopolize the coordination of transporting goods at the Los Indios port of entry in Texas.

Court records also revealed Martinez’s ties to cartel leadership. During a detention hearing in July 2023, a federal agent testified that Martinez had boasted about connections to criminal networks in Matamoros and Reynosa. Martinez is married to the daughter of Cárdenas Guillén. The former cartel leader founded the Zetas n 1997 using Mexican special forces members, according to Britannica. They were the paramilitary wing of the Gulf Cartel for a time before breaking away following Guillén’s capture and were responsible for some of the most violent crimes in Mexico.

Martinez’s plea agreement includes an 11-year prison term with sentencing set for May, the AP reported. His attorney, Kent A. Schaffer, said in a statement that the resolution would allow Martinez to return home sooner after having already spent two years in custody.
Meanwhile, his father-in-law was recently deported to Mexico, where he is accused of murder and illegal possession of a firearm, according to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement press release. Guillén, once one of the most feared cartel leaders, had been sentenced in the U.S. in 2010 to 25 years in prison on drug and money laundering charges. He was also convicted of threatening a federal agent.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/constitutional-crisis-impoundment-control-act-takes-center-stage-washington,Right,"Fox News host Laura Ingraham reports that President-elect Donald Trump nominated Russ Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget again.
A power struggle concerning government spending is heating up in Washington, D.C., igniting what some Senate Democrats call a ""constitutional crisis"" amid the Trump administration’s efforts to curb government waste.
The conflict stems from President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Russell Vought, and was exacerbated when the Trump administration announced it would freeze federal grants and loans on Jan. 27 in an OMB memo.
Both Trump and Vought share a common point of contention: the Impoundment Control Act.
The 1974 law, which Trump and Vought both argue is unconstitutional, reasserts Congress' power of the purse and bars the executive branch from unilaterally side-stepping Congress and withholding appropriated funds.
However, many legal experts warn that the matter is not up for debate, and the courts are clear; it is unconstitutional for the executive branch to divert dollars Congress has authorized.
The Senate voted to confirm Vought on Thursday by a 53–47 margin along party lines, following a 30-hour delay from Democrats in protest against his nomination.
Republicans claim that Vought is qualified to lead the department because he previously served in that role during Trump’s first term. Sen. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Wednesday that Vought would ""be able to hit the ground running.""
However, Democrats remained staunchly opposed to Vought's nomination and claimed his views on impoundment disqualified him from the role, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arguing on Wednesday that Trump and Vought believe ""they may be above the law.""
However, what is the Impoundment Control Act? Here is a look at what's up for debate regarding government spending — and what changes could emerge during the Trump administration.
Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to manage the federal budget to determine funding decisions to balance power between the branches of government.
However, the act of impoundment occurs when the executive branch chooses to not spend these approved dollars from Congress, since the executive branch and the Office of Budget and Management do oversee the actual spending of the approved funds.
Should a president want to spend less than what Congress has budgeted, the executive branch must secure approval from Congress. Deferring funds also requires the executive branch to inform Congress.
As a result, Congress passed the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to establish these proper channels of congressional oversight if a president chooses to withhold or defer these funds.
‘ULTRA-RIGHT’: TRUMP BUDGET CHIEF PICK RUSSELL VOUGHT FACES FIRE FROM DEM SENATORS

Vought’s opponents voiced concern that his leadership would lead to more cases like the freeze of federal grants and loans disclosed in an OMB memo on Jan. 27, a move that Democrats say was illegal and violated the Impoundment Control Act.
""As much as Trump desires it, the president is not a king,"" Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told reporters on Jan. 28. ""As much as Trump desires it, a law is not a suggestion.""
""These are not questions of opinion,"" Merkley said. ""These are principles at the heart of our constitutional system. It's at the heart of our checks and balances, and thus we have a constitutional crisis.""
Vought repeatedly defended his stance that the Impoundment Control Act was unconstitutional in multiple confirmation hearings and claimed that presidents historically could spend less than what Congress had earmarked prior to 1974.
Proponents of executive impoundment frequently point to Thomas Jefferson’s administration in 1803, when Congress appropriated funding for 15 gunboats. However, Jefferson held off on purchasing the boats to not aggravate France amid delicate discussions between then-Secretary of State James Madison and Napoleon. The purchase of the boats eventually became unnecessary following the Louisiana Purchase.
Additionally, Vought’s Center for Renewing America, a nonprofit Vought founded in 2021, has said impoundment allows the executive branch to exert fiscal discipline and that the president has the authority to determine if funds are used in the most efficient manner.
Vought did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
However, according to multiple legal experts, the Constitution and the courts are clear that spending appropriations fall under the parameters of the legislative branch.
Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, told Fox News Digital, ""The president has the constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and that includes spending.
""So I don't know where Mr. Vought gets the view that somehow the president has the right to decide what the government is going to spend money on,"" he said. ""This is Congress' job.""
Despite Trump and Vought’s views that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, McConnell said that he believed there is ""no reasonable prospect that the court is going to agree with that.
""The person who would have been the recipient of the funding will have some standing to sue,"" McConnell said. ""So, I would assume that if there's an impoundment, there will be an immediate lawsuit under the Impoundment Control Act.""

Other legal experts agreed that should the Trump administration attempt to withhold funds, the courts would step in and assert that there is no legal basis to do so.
That is because this is not a murky legal issue, according to Georgetown Law professor Stephen Vladeck.
""There are contested issues of constitutional law, but this just isn't one of them,"" Vladeck told Fox News Digital. ""Were it otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in having a legislative branch.""
Legal experts claim the courts historically have upheld the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act, and point to the 1975 case Train v. City of New York. In that case, the Supreme Court determined the Environmental Protection Agency must use full funding included in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, even though then-President Richard Nixon issued orders not to use all the funding.
Vought himself admitted in a Jan. 22 confirmation hearing that no court of law has found the Impoundment Control Act unconstitutional.
The courts did step into action following the recent OMB memo outlining a pause in federal grants and loans, and two federal judges have temporarily blocked the freeze.
Although the White House did rescind the memo pausing the federal aid on Jan. 29, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the move did not equate to a ""rescission of the federal funding freeze.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Vought's nomination and comments from Democrats that the memo was ""illegal.""
The memo did not appear to alarm Republican leadership in Congress, who publicly characterized the pause as standard protocol during an administrative turnover.
""I think that's a normal practice at the beginning of administration, until they have an opportunity to review how the money is being spent,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters on Jan. 27. ""We'll see kind of what the extent of it is, and … what they intend to do in a more fulsome way. But for now, I think it's just, it's just kind of a preliminary step that I think most administrations take,"" Thune said.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also told reporters on Jan. 27 the memo did not concern him and that he ""fully"" supported it, labeling the directive a ""common application of common sense.""
Even so, the memo further intensified opposition to Vought’s nomination. Specifically, Democrats urged the entire Senate to reject Vought’s nomination on Jan. 30 in response, following a committee vote advancing his nomination to the Senate floor.
Merkely noted that Vought oversaw the OMB in 2019 when the office held up $214 million in military aid for Ukraine — an issue that emerged as a key point in Trump’s first impeachment. Ultimately, the Government Accountability Office determined in 2020 the move did violate the Impoundment Control Act, ahead of Trump's Senate impeachment trial. The Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump.
Therefore, Merkley characterized Vought as ""dangerously unfit"" to lead OMB and a ""dangerous threat to our constitutional system of representative democracy.""
Josh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, said such language such as ""constitutional crisis"" is reasonable considering Congress’s spending power is one of the few but critical ways the legislative branch ensures the executive branch doesn’t exert too much power.
""These kinds of impoundments are not just unconstitutional, but they're actually anti-constitutional,"" Chafetz told Fox News Digital. ""They strike at the very foundation of our constitutional order.""
Democrats also don’t believe the recent memo is an isolated incident. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. cautioned on Jan. 30 that Vought would seek to withhold funds again overseeing OMB — if the Senate confirms him.
Vought himself signaled the Trump administration could initiate reform on impoundment law. In a confirmation hearing on Jan. 22, Vought told lawmakers that while an exact strategy is not intact yet, the Trump administration plans to complete a review with the Justice Department to explore the ""parameters of the law with regard to the Impoundment Control Act,"" should the Senate confirm him.
Vought also noted that some lawmakers who agree with his position on impoundment have proposed legislation on the matter. For example, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced legislation in December 2024 to repeal the Impoundment Control Act, arguing that the law’s ""unconstitutional limitations"" on the executive branch have ""contributed to a fiscal crisis.""

While many legal experts agree the legislative branch is the proper channel for reforming the Impoundment Control Act, Chafetz doubts there is an appetite to do so and that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle would ultimately view such attempts as an ""attack on their institution.""

As a result, Vladeck said that the Trump administration only has two means to navigate the Impoundment Control Act: either adhere to it or modify it.
""As for what we can expect going forward, it's entirely possible that the administration will try to push the envelope,"" Vladeck said. ""But the onus ought to be on the administration to follow the procedure Congress and the president agreed to in 1974 — or to make the case for why he shouldn't have to.""

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/12/23/us-higher-education-is-staring-at-an-uncertain-future-under-trump,Lean Left,"Rashid Khalidi, America’s foremost scholar on Palestine, best described the sorry state of higher education in the United States today in a recent interview.
Explaining his decision to retire from his position as Edward Said chair of modern Arab history at Columbia University, he said, “I didn’t want to be a cog in that machine any more.
“For some time now, I have been both disgusted and horrified by the way higher education has developed into a cash register – essentially a money-making, MBA, lawyer-run, hedge fund-cum-real estate operation, with a minor sideline in education, where money has determined everything, where respect for pedagogy is at a minimum”.
Regrettably, the situation that pushed Khalidi into what many see as a much too early retirement is likely to get much worse in the near future.
President-elect Donald Trump has promised to launch an all-out attack on American universities as soon as he returns to the White House.
On the campaign trail, Trump cited the rising tuition fees at colleges and universities. But UPenn-educated Trump placed the blame on “radical Left accreditors” who had allowed universities to be “dominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics”. His running mate, Yale University graduate JD Vance, meanwhile, called university professors the “enemy” and has pledged to “honestly and aggressively attack universities”.
The broad strokes of what this presidency plans to achieve in higher education are already laid out in the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a conservative takeover of the state and all its institutions, Project 2025. The project calls for the dismantling of all diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and the rejection and removal of “gender ideology” and critical race theory from all teaching material. It underlines the need to prohibit accreditors from requiring educational institutions to adopt DEI policies. It insists on the need to protect faith-based institutions from accreditation agencies’ standards and criteria that they believe “undermine religious beliefs”. Project 2025 also calls for an end to loan forgiveness programs and, eventually, the closing of the Department of Education.
Trump may not be able to achieve all this during his upcoming term. But some of his stated plans for higher education are well within reach and will likely be implemented in some form or other within the next year.
Trump has promised, for example, to “fire radical left accreditors” and “Marxist diversity, equity, and inclusion bureaucrats” and replace them with those committed to upholding a new set of standards, which include “defending the American tradition and Western civilization”. While he will likely not be able to change the way higher education accreditation is done in the US in the short term, he could easily create an environment, and pass regulation, that would pressure institutions to move away from DEI initiatives.
To the detriment of minority and marginalised communities’ access to higher education, Trump could easily weaponise the Department of Justice and federal civil rights laws to target institutions that continue with DEI efforts and tax endowment. He could also withhold federal funding to “force ideological conformity and promote conservative program preferences” at US universities. This would include forcing university leaders to crack down on Palestine solidarity activists or, as Trump puts it, “pro-Hamas radicals” to make college campuses “safe and patriotic again”.
Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, will likely be in the eye of the storm as well. Biden-era expansion of the definition of the scope of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation has irked the conservatives. Therefore, the incoming Trump administration can be expected to remove existing protections for LGBTQ+ students and staff at federally funded colleges. Under Title IX, the Biden administration had also boosted “safeguards for victims of campus sexual assault” by expanding the definition of sexual harassment and ending the requirement of live hearings Trump introduced during his first term. Trump is now expected to revert these changes by “tightening the definition of sexual harassment, raising the standard of proof for allegations and [once again] allowing live hearings”.
Access to higher education will also be under attack under Trump. He has publicly deemed federal loan forgiveness programs, and programs aimed at keeping monthly loan payments low and reducing the time it takes to pay off loans as “unlawful and unfair”. His administration is expected to scrap these. Of course, this will mean that millions of low-income and middle-income students would be unable to afford higher education.
Trump’s immigration policies and mass deportation plans will also have an effect on higher education. Currently, there are 408,000 undocumented students in higher education institutions in the US. Many states provide these students access to in-state tuition and state financial aid. Only three states prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public colleges. Under Trump, many more public institutions may feel compelled to – or outright be forced to – do the same. Trump’s incoming Education Secretary, former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and passionate anti-DEI advocate Linda McMahon, will undoubtedly work hard to turn Trump’s grim vision for American higher education into reality.
Some have pledged to push back.
In August, responding to JD Vance’s promise to “aggressively attack universities in this country” if elected into office, American Association of University Professors (AAUP) President Todd Wilson said, “We are in a crucial moment that will decide the future of higher education for decades to come. Colleges and universities are the bedrock of American democracy and the engine of social mobility, innovation, and progress. We can’t allow fascists to strip it away. Now is the time to fight.”
After the elections, Wilson urged institutions, faculty, staff and students to organise, arguing that the crisis in the sector, with dwindling public funding, rising student debt and increasing attacks on academic freedom, “will only be intensified” under Trump 2.0.
Others, however, appear to perceive the Trump agenda for higher education as the will of the American people, and seem willing to reach a compromise with an administration openly voicing its desire to reshape the entire sector to fall in line with its ideological preferences.
For example, in a statement after the elections defending DEI efforts and academic freedom at US universities, president of Wesleyan University Michael S Roth also suggested that universities “need to be willing to listen” to the point of view of Trump/Vance as millions of Americans had “made their voices heard with their votes [for them]”. Meanwhile, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) – one of the seven nonprofit accrediting groups in the US that oversees 170 colleges in Hawaii and California – has already proposed the removal of “diversity, equality and inclusion” from its accreditation standards. PEN America expressed its concerns regarding the timing of this measure, adding that doing so “in the face of an incoming president who has threatened to ‘fire the accreditors’ … cannot help but create the perception that WASC is bowing to political pressure”.
That certain leaders and institutions of American higher education appear to be bowing to Trump even before he officially moves back into the White House should not surprise anyone. Higher education has always been a tool of American soft power, and its institutions have been eagerly serving the agenda of the state – whatever this agenda may be – since their very inception. Under Trump, America is poised to reposition itself in the world and restructure its internal dynamics. The incoming administration has made it clear that these grand alterations to “make America great again” will require a complete revamp of the education system. American universities may not have a choice but to accept their fate and adapt.

Trump has cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, a law giving presidents authority to restrict trade in some circumstances, as authority for his power to impose tariffs. At issue is whether the IEEPA gives Trump that power and whether the “major questions doctrine” leads to the conclusion that it does not, Bloomberg Law reports.
Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on imports from China, but he paused threatened tariffs of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico. Trump said tariffs are needed because of “the grave threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs” at the borders, creating a national emergency.
Under the major questions doctrine, Congress must “speak clearly” when authorizing an executive branch agency to make decisions of vast economic and political significance, wrote Ilya Somin, a professor at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School, at the Volokh Conspiracy. If a statute is ambiguous, the presumption is that the power was not granted.
The major questions doctrine has been “reinvigorated” by the U.S. Supreme Court in striking down the federal eviction moratorium and vaccine mandates imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bloomberg Law says.
The Supreme Court also cited the doctrine when it ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency didn’t have broad power to regulate climate change and that the Biden administration didn’t have the power to forgive student loans.
Somin argued that imposing “massive tariffs” is “pretty obviously” a decision with vast economic and political significance with high costs to the public. And the statute under which Trump claimed authority is far from clear, as were the statutes in the student loan and eviction moratorium cases, he wrote.
The IEEPA is a “vague statute” that authorizes presidents to restrict trade when there is “any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat,” Somin wrote.
Peter E. Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, also sees an argument regarding the major questions doctrine, particularly for “universal baseline” tariffs imposing a specific percentage charge on all imports.
“Courts should find that allowing Trump to waive his magic sharpie to sign an IEEPA executive order imposing tariffs would upset the balance Congress has long sought to strike when it delegates its tariff authority to the president,” he wrote in a Lawfare post.
Apart from the major questions doctrine, an argument could be made that the plain text of the IEEPA doesn’t give presidents tariff authority, Harrell wrote.
Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to set tariffs and regulate commerce with foreign nations. A president’s power to set tariffs comes from delegated authority by Congress, Harrell wrote. The IEEPA gives a president the power to ban or limit exports and imports, but the list “notably” does not explicitly include the power to impose tariffs or taxes.
Saikrishna Prakash, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, told Bloomberg Law that the opposite argument is that the broad powers granted by the law should include the lesser power of imposing tariffs.
The “IEEPA allows a very broad power to ban commerce, and so given that, why can’t the president do something less?” Prakash asks.
Somin sees yet another argument that the the nondelegation doctrine applies. It allows broad delegations of power when they are based on an “intelligible principle.” Some Supreme Court justices have expressed interest in “tightening up” the doctrine, and a tariff challenge “might be a good opportunity to do just that,” he wrote.
Somin doesn’t argue that a challenge to tariffs is likely to succeed.
“But the arguments are strong,” he wrote, particularly those in support of the major questions doctrine.",debra cassens weiss february cst importer want challenge tariff imposed president donald trump argue doe power argument slam dunk legal expert say photo shutterstock importer want challenge tariff imposed president donald trump argue doe power argument slam dunk legal expert say trump cited international emergency economic power act law giving president authority restrict trade circumstance authority power impose tariff issue ieepa give trump power major question doctrine lead conclusion doe bloomberg law report trump imposed tariff import china paused threatened tariff good canada mexico trump said tariff needed grave threat united state posed influx illegal alien illicit drug border creating national emergency major question doctrine congress speak clearly authorizing executive branch agency make decision vast economic political significance wrote ilya somin professor george mason university antonin scalia law school volokh conspiracy statute ambiguous presumption power granted major question doctrine reinvigorated supreme court striking federal eviction moratorium vaccine mandate imposed covid pandemic bloomberg law say supreme court cited doctrine ruled environmental protection agency did broad power regulate climate change biden administration did power forgive student loan somin argued imposing massive tariff pretty obviously decision vast economic political significance high cost public statute trump claimed authority far clear statute student loan eviction moratorium case wrote ieepa vague statute authorizes president restrict trade unusual extraordinary threat source substantial outside united state national security foreign policy economy united state president declares national emergency respect threat somin wrote peter harrell adjunct senior fellow center new american security see argument regarding major question doctrine particularly universal baseline tariff imposing specific percentage charge import court allowing trump waive magic sharpie sign ieepa executive order imposing tariff upset balance congress long sought strike delegate tariff authority president wrote lawfare post apart major question doctrine argument plain text ieepa doe president tariff authority harrell wrote article section constitution give congress authority set tariff regulate commerce foreign nation president power set tariff come delegated authority congress harrell wrote ieepa give president power ban limit export import list notably doe explicitly include power impose tariff tax saikrishna prakash professor university virginia school law told bloomberg law opposite argument broad power granted law include lesser power imposing tariff ieepa allows broad power ban commerce given ca president prakash asks somin see argument nondelegation doctrine applies allows broad delegation power based intelligible principle supreme court justice expressed tightening doctrine tariff challenge good opportunity just wrote somin doe argue challenge tariff likely succeed argument strong wrote particularly support major question doctrine

That relief includes will go to 85,000 people who attended schools that ""cheated and defrauded their students,"" 61,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability, and another 6,100 public service workers, Biden said in a statement.
""Since Day One of my Administration, I promised to ensure higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity, and I'm proud to say we have forgiven more student loan debt than any other administration in history,"" Biden said.
Since Biden took office, he has forgiven debt for more than 5 million federal student loan borrowers, totaling $183.6 billion in relief.
In 2023, the Supreme Court blocked the president's plan to deliver wide-scale student loan forgiveness for tens of millions of borrowers.
But the Biden administration still managed to wipe away a large share of the country's outstanding student debt by improving the U.S. Department of Education's existing debt relief programs.
Monday's announcement is for $465 million in loan cancellation for public servants, $2.5 billion for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities, and more than $1.25 billion for defrauded students.",final day office president joe biden announced administration forgive student debt borrower relief includes people attended school cheated defrauded student borrower total permanent disability public service worker biden said statement day administration promised ensure higher education ticket middle class barrier opportunity proud say forgiven student loan debt administration history biden said biden took office forgiven debt million federal student loan borrower totaling billion relief supreme court blocked president plan deliver wide scale student loan forgiveness ten million borrower biden administration managed wipe away large share country outstanding student debt improving department education existing debt relief program monday announcement million loan cancellation public servant billion borrower total permanent disability billion defrauded student
